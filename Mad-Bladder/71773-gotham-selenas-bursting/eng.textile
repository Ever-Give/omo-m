This story takes place in the old Fox show Gotham, and stars 21 year old Bruce and Selena. Except Bruce never left Gotham

The Wayne Family charity event was being held at Gotham hall, and Bruce couldn’t wait to bring his date: the lovely Selena Kyle. Although wanting to wear her normal black tights and jacket with curly messy hair, Alfred had been able to convince her to tidy up.

Bruce knocked on the door.

“Selena, we’re going to be late!”

“Jeez, Bruce. Calm down, you have these charity events like every month. It’s not my fault you made me redo my hair, makeup, all that stuff.”

“You know I think you’re beautiful Selena. But for these events, image is key.”

“Yeah, yeah.”

Selena opened the bathroom door, and Bruce looked at her, jaw-dropped.

“Wipe that drool, Bruce,” she smiled with her hands on her hips. She wore a short black dress with web nylons and dark boots. She had a small red jacket, and her hair wrapped up.

“You look…amazing, Selena.”

“Yeah, yeah. Let’s go, romance boy.” She ruffed his arm but stopped and grabbed her belly. “Oof!”

“What is it?”

“Bathroom break. Had too much wine before while you were getting ready.”

Alfred came in the room. “Master Bruce, we must get going.”

“Right. Selena, can you wait until we get to the event?”

She sighed and bounced. Her legs tightened down the middle. “Fine. Let’s go.”
