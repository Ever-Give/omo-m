Prologue, context

Giang Huynh, or Jan, as she likes to be called, is a freshman in college. She was born in Vietnam, but immigrated to America when she was too young to remember. Growing up, she was a bit of a troublemaker. She barely got into college due to all the antics she was up to during her high school years. It’s safe to say that Jan could be considered attractive. Both conventionally, stylewise, and personality wise. She’s an extremely sociable girl who makes friends with just about anyone she talks to. Though she loved being part of large gatherings and social circles, she loved using class, and her apartment just off campus as her little me-time hideaways. She always sat in the somewhat unpopulated rear of the lecture hall, after all.

However, unbeknownst to everyone around her, Giang had a side to her she swore to never show. Beneath her peppy, socially harmless exterior, she held multiple strange, obsessive fetishes that lead to her leading two lifestyles at the same time. In one, she projected the appearance of a quirky, cheery, people pleaser girl. I’m the other, she lived in constant agony to feed her masochistic desires. She lived a double entendre. Her clothes were not light just for looks.

Chap 1. Rationing and Retaining

Giang sat in the back of the class as usual, her patience being tested. She had spent the last week making plans with a bunch of her friends. Her day would pan out something like this;

7:00 AM - 12:00 PM - Classes

12:15 PM - 1:00 PM - Coffee with Paige

1:15 PM - 2:45 PM - Boba tea with Ana

3:00 PM - 6:30 PM - Mall trip with the group

6:30 PM - 9:30 PM - Dinner with the group

Giang knew that such a plan would be completely impossible for her bladder to survive. Despite her forcing it to stretch and expand to accommodate her desire to hold more urine, her bladder, especially at its current state, would already be at its capacity before she reached the coffee shop. She had thought of a proper solution though. She had come up with the idea to pee in small increments to keep her safe just long enough that she could pass it off as regular bathroom breaks. Her plan was foolproof, Giangproof, even. Despite her distracting discomfort from her bladder, she still smiled to herself, knowing tonight would play out flawlessly.

Giang sat with her legs doubly crossed, and both her hands knifed deeply in her crotch. She wore a white suspender skirt over a white frilly tube top, white nylons, and a pair of white over-the-knee socks. She had a comically large white bow in her hair, the ribbons from it ran to her calves. She looked at the clock on her laptop, 11:57 AM. Just about time to leave. She took a second to mentally prepare, she was certainly at her limit. All she had to do was make it to the bathroom before all of the other girls jammed it up, and act as natural as possible doing it. Easy.

She stood up with utmost confidence, her bladder was so bloated that it propped the font of her skirt up a little, much to her amusement. Standing up had sent chills, sweats, numbness, and pain through Giang’s entire body, a feeling she had long become used to. She slid her laptop in to her handbag, and kept up her composure all the way to the door. She checked her watch while stealthily clasping her thighs together. Right as she checked it, the bell rang. She marched out of the classroom, and almost jogged her way to the bathroom. Luckily, she had made it in time to steal the last stall. Closing the stall door was like closing the door to a fallout shelter while hordes of hopeless refugees cry and beg to be let in.

Giang pulled her stockings and underwear down, and let out just enough to feel somewhat more confident. Good. She swiftly turned around and opened her bag. She had a change of clothes for her night out this afternoon. She began to change into her new outfit. A pair of white high-waisted dolphin shorts, a white lacy bra, a pair of white thigh high socks with garters to stretch them up, and a pair of white 14cm pumps to replace her casual sneakers. She opted out of wearing underwear, because she wanted the extra risk of a leak being seen if she had one. She ran her hands over her bladder bulge. It hadn’t gotten any smaller, just a little less firm. She felt warm and fuzzy all over, aroused by the feeling of all her pee pooled up inside her.

Giang picked up all her stuff, and promptly left the stall. The coffee shop wasn’t far, she could already see it just down the road. Giang considered what she should do. Logically, she shouldn’t have anything considering her bladder was already stretched and in severe pain. But her desire for a worse time was greater than her social obligation to not be a weirdo, so she already knew what to have. She heard the fast stomping of combat boots, and turned around, and saw Paige frantically sprinting towards her. “Oh my god, am I late? I must be so late! Ohh, I’m so sorry, I think I got my schedule wrong.” She complained as she approached.

“No, no, you aren’t late.” Giang consoled, “We’re actually ten minutes early.”

Giang always used an extremely high pitched, somewhat whispery voice to sell the idea that she was a living anime character. Paige sighed and bent over, exhausted from running. She used Giang as a support since the two had such a height difference. Paige wore a dark green thick knit sweater tucked into a pair of oversized jean shorts, black nylon stockings, and a pair of black combat boots. “Hoo.. That’s good, that's good.” She stood up and pulled up her shorts. “Let’s go, I am craving coffee so bad right now.”

They went in the store, and after a surprisingly short wait in line, went up to order. “I’ll have an iced triple espresso, trenta.” Said Paige.

“Could I please get whatever tastes the most vanilla like? Extra vanilla, Decaf please. Medium” Giang ordered.

The thought of fluid immediately made Giang’s bladder fight back with multiple strong waves of intense pain. Giang was more than used to it, her bladder had been just like this every single day for years. Giang stood with Paige, waiting for their coffees. “I love your outfit today, slaying the look with the all white, tall socks.” Paige commented.

“Thank you so much, I really like your outfit too.” Giang responded.

They continued making small talk for a minute until their drinks came out. Once they got their drinks, they left the coffee shop to go walk around on campus. Giang took a sip of the coffee, and just as it hit her tongue, her bladder reacted with an incredibly sharp pain pulsing through her body, it felt like she was being stabbed all over. Still, she maintained composure and kept herself proper. Despite the somewhat chilly environment outside, the stress of her hold was causing her to sweat a little. “Hey Jan, I also have some time open tomorrow, if you want to come after class.”

Giang nodded and hummed affirmatively. She noticed that her drink was almost empty. Had she been walking for that long? She didn't remember drinking this much of her drink. She checked her watch, it was already 12:50. “Oh my goodness!” Giang exclaimed. “I'm gonna be late for my appointment!”

Paige looked confused, “Really? I hope I didn’t keep you for too long! You really shouldn’t be late.”

Giang started jogging towards the boba place, quickly drinking the last of her beverage. She turned back for a second and waved at Paige. “See ya tomorrow!” she exclaimed.

While Giang walked to the boba place, she reflected upon her bladder. She had decided to stop using the bathroom when she felt the need to pee some time after dinner the night before. She stayed awake all night, feeling as her bladder filled up. She then spent the whole time at school retaining her urine. Years of holding had gotten her well equipped against her bladder, and she was ready to abuse it to no extent today.

“Good afternoon, Jan.” Whispered Ana.

Giang looked around, seeing a girl dressed in what seemed to be an incredibly elaborate victorian era dress in all black. Along with it, she wore an extremely tight corset, a pair of long leather gloves, a black bride’s veil over her eyes, and behind her, and a black hat with a rim large enough to shade most of her exposed skin, which would just be her shoulders, neck, face, and some of her upper chest.

Ana is quite the character, she is as mysterious as she is gorgeous. Her skin looked bleached, albino, a perfect paper white. She never spoke louder than a murmur, and the distinct tapping wherever she walked implied she wore ballerina shoes, and only walked on the very tips of her toes.

Giang held her hand out for a hand shake, Ana grabbed it, slid her veil out of the way, and kissed Giang’s hand. “It is such a pleasure to see you here. It has been so long since I last went out, so I greatly appreciate the invite.”

Giang smiled, not phased by Ana’s strange mannerisms. “I’m happy you decided to come.”

The boba place, being farther off campus, was nowhere near as packed. The two ordered their drinks, and Giang walked to a seat. Ana shook her head. “I’m sorry, Jan, I cannot sit today, this dress was not made for that.

Giang looked surprised. “All day?”

“Yes, I must stand the whole day, but don’t dwell on it, we only have a short time to enjoy our tea before we must part.”

At that very moment, Giang went into conversational autopilot. Her consciousness, self, and soul had been dragged into a different state. She was suddenly hot with the sudden stab of her bladder as she took her first sip of the tea. She held her handbag in front of her crotch to stealthily use her hand to assist holding. She was sweating a little more than before, and despite the fact that she was smiling, nodding, and could feel her lips giving proper, thought out responses to Ana’s conversation, she herself had gone completely deaf. And felt nothing but agony from her incredibly strained bladder.

Giang continued pressing her urethra. She awkwardly shifted her weight where she stood, and could never stay perfectly still, always moving her hips or fumbling her handbag a little. Was this what happened during the coffee meetup? She didn’t know. Her bladder kept trying to discourage her from holding and drinking with more and more sharp, pulsating pains, but it was nullified, since she only felt pleasure from pain.

Giang finished her tea, and Ana waved goodbye, much to Giang’s confusion. Giang then checked her watch. It was already 2:40! At least this time, she wasn’t late. She tossed the empty cup in a nearby trash can, and began her way towards the mall. Giang stopped immediately and held her hand to her bladder, bulging more than it had before. The weight of all of the fluids in her had made her feel much more sluggish and heavy, walking at her normal pace would be strenuous and tiring.

Giang stepped forward, and began walking at a fraction of her normal pace. Even then, her bladder felt like a bowling ball held up by a rubber band. It heaved up and down and made anything it touched ache. She held one hand under her bladder bulge, admiring it like a pregnant belly.

Suddenly, her high heel got stuck in a sidewalk gap, and she rolled her ankle. When she caught herself from falling, she let out a spurt into her shorts. It not only caused a noticeable, dark wet spot, but shot through her shorts with such incredible pressure, that when it hit the ground, the upsplash darkened her socks around the ankles. It was at this moment that she realized she needed to find a way to release more pressure immediately, because there was no way she could make it home, let alone the mall without wetting herself.

Giang frantically looked around, was anyone looking? By some measure of luck, the street was empty of both pedestrians, and cars. Not a person in sight. She was split, should she wet herself more? Or should she find a place to pee? She weighed the pros and cons of each option. On one hand, if she wet herself, she would have huge wet spots on her shorts and stockings, but would most likely not smell like anything due to how watered down her urine is, plus, it would most likely dry before she got to the mall. If she peed somewhere, there would be no cons.

She looked around again, nobody. She took off her heels, placed them beside her, and crossed her legs tightly to ensure her stockings weren’t safe. Slowly, she put both of her hands on her bladder. It felt like a ball of solid steel, even her skin had been stretched to the point where it was solid, and had no give. She breathed in heavily, and simultaneously pushed her pee out, and pressed on her bladder as hard as she could with both hands. A jet of pee shot out of her with unimaginable force. Everything that could have possibly been wettened by it, was. She used her hand to cover her urethra and stop peeing after about 5 seconds, and quickly put her heels back on.

Realization dawned upon Giang. How could she be so stupid?! There may have not been anyone here, but there was a whole city’s worth of people that could see her after this! She quickly covered her face with both of her hands, and fell to the ground, struggling to not cry. She kept looking around to make sure nobody was around her, and still, the street was empty. It was at that moment that she realized she still had a change of clothes in her bag. She unzipped it and looked inside. Perfect. She could wear this, run to the mall as fast as she could now that her bladder was taken care of, and then wait for it to dry, just in time for her appearance to her friend group.

Right in the middle of the empty street, Giang stripped down completely, and changed into her previous outfit, she swapped her heels for sneakers, and after being dressed, she pointed herself in the direction of the mall, and ran like hell.

Luckily, years of Giang holding unyieldingly all the time led to her inevitably training herself to keep a full bladder steady, even when she played her high school sports. Giang still plays all sorts of sports in her off time, including, but not limited to; basketball, baseball, soccer, volleyball, and golf.

After only a few minutes of running, she had already made it to the mall. She went into the bathroom, and into the disability stall. She took her wet clothes from her bag, and began drying them off under the electric air dryer. Her bladder felt like shattered glass rustling around in her body whenever she looked at the toilet right behind her. It didn’t take long before the clothes were dry enough for the wetness to not be visible. They still felt wet to the touch, but they were certainly wearable.

Giang’s phone rang, it was Paige. Giang’s friends had arrived at the mall. Giang declined the call and texted Paige to let her know she was already there. Giang changed as quickly as she could, and calmly walked out of the bathroom like nothing had ever happened. The bathroom hallway was perpendicular to the food court, so she could see her friend group standing in the dining area. She waved at the group, Paige saw her and waved back.

“Aww, you got to use the bathroom? Lucky..” Paige lamented, to Giang’s visible confusion.

“Why don’t you just go, then?”

“I never use public bathrooms, they’re nasty.”

Giang shrugged in agreement, even though she never used any bathrooms.

“Ugh.. That iced coffee is gonna make me pee my pants.” She mumbled, followed by a short giggle. “Oh well. Life’s life.”

Paige bent over a little again and again. She also casually stood with her legs crossed, swaying her upper body side to side a little. Giang was very attentive. Though Paige was a very intelligent girl, she was a very careless klutz herself, and rarely ever planned ahead in the short term. This was the first time it had come back to bite her in a language Giang understood, though.

The group, besides Paige and Giang, was all huddled up, discussing something. They suddenly split apart. “Guys, let’s all split up and go shopping separately. We’ll get back together at 6:20 sharp to start going to the restaurant.” A girl announced.

Everyone nodded at this, and people began assembling into little groups and quickly leaving to go to shops. This soon left Paige and Giang as the only two girls of the group in the food court. “Is the bathroom nasty? I might go..” Paige asked

“It was fucking rancid.” Responded Giang.

Paige groaned in annoyance, “Fuuck.. I have to pee so bad.”

“Don’t worry about it.” Giang assured Paige. “By the way, can you give me a ride home?”

Paige seemed distracted by this, and nodded, smiling. “Of course! Oh- and I gotta get new nylons. I ripped a bunch of mine.”

Giang nodded, and held out her hand. Paige took it, and they walked together to the shop Paige needed to visit. Paige hunched forward a little as she walked. Her breathing was a little bit nervous, and it was obvious that her bladder was bothering her a lot. They walked in to the store, and towards the left wall, where the nylon tights were. Paige stood cross-legged, twisty, and a little bent as she picked a few packages off the racks. “What shade should I get?” She inquired.

Giang thought about it for a second, “Get both. Wear the lighter ones over the winter, and darker ones in the summer.”

“Okay, that’s a good idea.”

“Oh, and you need to get stockings with garters!” Giang exclaimed.

“Where? I will buy them right now if you can find them.”

Giang shrugged, so Paige began walking around, still hunched over a little.

Eventually, they found the aisle where such garments were. Paige got a bunch of them, some solid, some transparent, some lacy, and a few fishnetted. At the checkout line, Paige asked the cashier if the store had an employee’s only bathroom, to which he broke the news that he used the mall’s restrooms. Paige thanked him for his assistance, her voice shaky.

Giang suggested looking at some shoes, to which Paige instantly agreed. It seemed she was trying to make it look like her bladder wasn’t bothering her. Giang tried out all sorts of crazy tall high heels, while Paige tried on combat boots, platformers combat boots, and heeled combat boots. In the end, Giang bought a pair of closed foot white 15cm heels, and Paige bought some 12cm platformed combat boots.

They left to go to the restaurant early, and sat at a bench while they waited for the reservation to open. “Oh my god… I have to pee, I have to pee!” Paige sobbed quietly, “there’s four hours before I get home and I’m gonna pee my pants!”

Paige sat with her legs doubly crossed, and bouncing, both her hands were covering her face as she cried. Giang ran her fingers through Paige’s hair, and consoled her. “Shhh.. Calm down, you’re strong, you can make it.” She said, “Chin up, the others are coming now.”

Paige gasped, and both of her hands shot into her crotch.

Sure enough, when they both got up, Giang could see a little dark spot towards the front of her shorts. She held Paige’s hand as they walked in. Paige looked pale, and terrified. Her hand shook a little. The two sat beside each other, still holding hands. A waitress walked up to the table, clipboard in hand. “Can I get you all something to drink?” She asked.

Paige seemingly immediately forgot about her current state, “I’ll have a tea, sweetened, no ice.” She ordered.

Giang nudged her head towards Paige, “Ill have what she’s having.”

Giang immediately pulled her phone out, and began to text Paige. “Are you doing alright?” She asked over text.

Paige felt her phone vibrate, and pulled it out. “I think I’m going to pee my pants” she responded, “like right now”

Giang seemingly ignored Paige’s cry of dispair, and tried to distract her, “I love your outfit so much” She texted.

“Thank you I got the sweater last week”

“You should wear the nylon tights more often, they look really good”

“Thank you, I would but this is my only pair”

“Let’s get you some more. Are you free tomorrow?”

“I’m always free”

“Nice”

Paige takes a large gulp of her tea, but then quickly begins pressing down tightly with one hand on her shorts where her urethra would be. She calmly puts her phone down, freeing up her other hand which she then used to press harder. Giang noticed the dark spot in Paige’s shorts growing substantially, albeit slowly. It spread to her tights, causing them to become shiny and reflective. They were already partially through their meal, and Paige had finished her drink. The waitress returned with a refill that Paige immediately started drinking. Paige quickly picked up her phone in a panic, and started texting Giang frantically. “Jan if i don’t stop drinking im going to pee all over myself”

“Stop drinking then.” Giang responded

Paige laughed audibly, then texted Giang, “I would but im so thirsty”

Giang sent a shrugging emoji, Paige sent a crying emoji in response.

“It hurts so much I have to pee so bad” Paige texted, before downing half of her tall glass of tea.

“We are leaving soon so you can get home”

Paige nodded, and slipped her phone into her wet back pocket, she had spent the past few minutes leaking and spurting, slowly darkening more and more of her shorts and making her leggings shiny. The restaurant lights were dark enough that it wasn’t visible at a glance. Slowly, members of the group paid and left, eventually leaving Giang and Paige as the only two at the table.

Giang got up, and Paige quickly followed, revealing the sheer damage her leaky bladder had caused to her clothes, everything above her knees and below her belt was dark and shiny with urine. She stood heavily hunched, one hand stuck between her legs to hold better. Giang pulled out her cell phone, and giggled. “This looks so embarrassing, I’m gonna take videos of you and blackmail you with them.” She said.

Paige laughed in return. Her smile looked genuine. Even she found her situation comedic. She looked up at Giang, who had already begun recording her slow attempts at walking to the car. “Oh my god, stop! This is so embarrassing!” Paige laughed.

Giang stopped recording. “I’m putting that in my blackmail folder” She joked.

They both eventually made it to Paige’s car. “Giang, can I please pee at your house when I drop you off?” She complained.

“Sure!” Giang cheered, “but I think we should get you more tights at the pharmacy first.”

Paige looked at Giang, and pointed at her. “Jan, you are a genius.”

Giang smiled gleefully. “Thanks!”

Paige calmly started driving, seemingly completely forgetting about her bladder. Giang watched as every little bump made a slight spurt of urine run down the center seam of Paige’s shorts. They soon made it to the pharmacy, and Paige stepped out of the car, practically folded in half and legs double crossed in an attempt to keep herself in check. She hobbled into the store with her legs crossed, and Giang led her to the aisle with all of the tights and stockings, and let Paige grab what she liked, while recording her all crossed and bent for her blackmail album.

Paige quickly checked out, and hurriedly hobbled back to her car. “Come on, Jan, I’m literally this close to peeing myself!” She whined.

Giang got in, and Paige rushed to Giang’s apartment. She hopped out and hobbled to the front door, waiting for Giang to open it. Giang took her time, and lied to Paige’s face. “The elevators are out of order this month.” She claimed.

Paige believed her, and immediately rushed to the stairwell, leaving a quickly increasing trail of drops and wet boot prints on the black tile floor of the lobby. She tried getting up the first flight of stairs to incredible difficulty. She took even longer to climb the second. Once they made it to the third floor of the building, she was leaving small puddles where she stood while working up the strength for each step. Giang held her room card to her door lock, and held the door open for Paige. “I love your apartment.. it’s very..”

Paige suddenly gasped, then squealed. She started hyperventilating, she sounded incredibly pained and on the verge of a breakdown. Her dripping increased to a small stream, which just kept going and going for what felt like centuries, her puddle of pee growing bigger and bigger. She desperately tried to stop it the whole time, but this only stressed her further. Eventually, once it was all over, she quietly cried where she stood, her knees weak from holding.

Giang put her hand gently on Paige’s shoulder, and used the other to push up her chin so they could make eye contact. “Hey, hey..” she coo’d, “it’s alright, Just mop up the puddle, okay?”

Paige nodded dejectedly, and left to go find a mop. Giang followed her. “If you’re tired, you can stay the night.”

Paige sniffled and nodded, mopping up her massive pee puddle. When she was finished, she put the mop away, and went to look at the damages in the bathroom mirror. Everything from the buttocks down was completely drenched. Her tights shiny, her once pale blue denim jeans now nearly black, and her combat boots sloshing about with her pee.

Paige didn't have the energy to remove the clothes. She was exhausted past the point of caring. She yawned, and wandered into Giang’s room. “I’m going to sleep now, are you?” She asked, peeking her head out of the doorway.

Giang shook her head. “I’m pulling an all nighter tonight.”

“Work?” Paige asked.

“Nope, just don’t want to sleep.”

Paige shrugged and went back into Giang’s room. “Goodnight!” She shouted.

“Night.” Giang replied.

Giang stood around for a few minutes, not particularly caring that Paige was sopping wet in her bed. She thought about the prior night, Paige seemed to be the type of person to be incredibly easily distracted, and seemingly had no considerations of what her current actions meant for her future. She was also a total yes-girl, and far too trusting. Giang considered taking advantage of this, she pulled a bottle of water from her pantry, and as soon as she pressed it to her lips, was hit with the overwhelming feeling of nausea, and the intense urge to vomit. Her body was hit with a pain so sharp, it made her almost fall to the ground. She looked down at her belly, her bladder made it look like she was almost a month pregnant. She could feel her ureters, stiff as rods from how much pee had been condensed into her urinary system that night.

She contemplated holding it longer, on one hand, she loved how her bladder looked and felt when it bloated, filled, and backed up as much as it did then. On the other hand, she was beginning to worry about the danger of holding much longer.. While she rubbed her bladder contemplating whether or not to hold, she suddenly gagged out of reflex to the pain. Yep, yep. It was definitely time to pee. She got up, and immediately hobbled to the kitchen. She had a 5 liter party pitcher that she had never used for anything besides measuring her bladder. She knew that it wasn’t really possible, but she yearned to one day have a bladder that could fill it completely. She knelt down over it, and just let go.

2,700 milliliters.
