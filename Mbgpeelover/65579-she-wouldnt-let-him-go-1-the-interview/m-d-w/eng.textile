She wouldn’t let him go. 1: The interview

Jamie sat in the bland waiting area with its neutral walls and standard low fabric seats. He was every bit as nervous as he had been at the dentist a month before and waiting for his daughter to be born 6 months before that. He legs felt like jelly, his heart racing, and worst of all his mouth felt dryer than a desert in the midst of summer. He hadn’t even been able to say his name at the reception desk, having to hand them his interview appointment instead. As he looked around anxiously his eyes rested on a vending drinks machine in the corner. Pushing himself to standing he tentatively walked towards it and punched in the numbers for a bottle of cold water.

Sitting back down he opened the bottle and gulped down a quarter of it quickly, hoping his voice might relax before he was called. The clock on the wall appeared stuck as he continued to sip continuously on the bottle for comfort as he tried focussing on what he might be asked.

By the time his name was called he glanced at the bottle in his hand and, realising it was empty, he dropped it in a bin as he followed the smartly dressed red haired young woman who had appeared looking for him.

Hearing the click click rhythm of her high heeled shoes on the hard flooring Jamie watched as her bottom wriggled sexily as he walked behind her. Deliberately looking away he thought about his partner and baby at home and smiled.

Walking into the boardroom the first thing Jamie sensed was an air of tension and formality. As the young lady he had followed slipped behind the formal solid desk beside another two suited and somber females he sensed immediately that this interview wasn’t one to crack jokes in. He gulped quietly as he sat on the only seat available facing the three ladies. Despite being in a formal suit with a shirt and tie he still felt inadequate and under dressed in contrast to the imposing females opposite him. As a full jug of iced water say in the middle of the table Jamie could feel the sweat gathering on his forehead as one of the woman poured the jug into four glasses and slid each one in front of a different person.

As the first question was fired Jamie’s voice box seemed to close in fear, and when nothing came out despite his mouth opening and closing he heard one of the females cough then comment loudly.

“I suggest you take a sip of water and try speaking again. Thank you.”

Jamie did as instructed but still his voice was husky and quiet.

“Take some more. I insist. We can not proceed further here until we can hear you. We don’t have all day to wait.”

Shaking with nerves Jamie did as instructed again until his glass was empty but his voice was at least loud enough to finally be heard. It was 45 minutes later before the questions from the ladies finally ended and Jamie left the imposing formal room and was lead out.

“If you could sit here please until we call you for part 2. There’s a kettle and biscuits over there but please remain in the corridor until called. Thank you.”

Jamie sat on the plastic chair in the empty corridor, flashbacks of sitting outside the headmasters office at high school filling his mind. The walls were bare and Jamie glanced up one end to see a fire exit at the far end but the other end seemed to go on forever with no exit in sight. A few doors marked ‘meeting 1’, ‘board room 2’ and so on were interspersed along both sides but other than a small table, which had clearly been temporarily placed for today’s interview, the corridor was otherwise empty.

Jamie sat crossed legged. Now wasn’t a good time to be needing a piss but the bottle of water in the waiting room and two further glasses in the interview had more than filled his bladder and he tried to think of anything but a toilet. He sat for a few minutes before standing and going over to the table where a kettle was plugged in and mugs, disposable milk sachets and sugar with plastic spoons sat waiting. Jamie looked up and down the corridor hoping to see a toilet, or at least signs to one, but there was nothing. Making himself a coffee and picking up a plain biscuit he returned to the plastic seat and returned to sitting with his legs crossed.

Twenty minutes later his coffee and biscuit were finished and he returned to the table to put his now empty mug on it. Now wanting a toilet even more he decided to wander a little further along the corridor slipping a hand into his trouser pocket to touch his penis to help hold. Moving was helping but there was no sign still of a bathroom and no-one around to ask. Jamie paced the corridor, walking back and forth from the plastic chair to the door marked boardroom 3 over and over wondering how much longer he’d be kept waiting.

Finally he heard voices as he walked quickly towards the chair as he saw the three woman who had just interviewed him earlier come out of the room.

‘Did we not say to wait on the chair?’

Jamie so desperately wanted to ask for a bathroom but he felt so intimidated and awkward than he just hung his head and sat back down. That was until one of the woman looked down at him, smiled coyly and whispered, ‘Is everything ok?’ Gulping shyly Jamie looked her in the eye and quietly answered. ‘I was, I was just looking to see if there was a bathroom I could maybe use please.’ The woman checked the other females were not watching before she covered the side of her mouth and mouthed back. ‘If you can wait a bit longer I’ll show you when I can.’

Jamie nodded but his feet were tapping now and he could feel his member throbbing in his boxers. Wait a bit longer? He really wanted to say that he wasn’t sure how much longer he could wait but he didn’t want to cause a fuss and this woman seemed his only hope.

‘I’ll update him on what we discussed and then show him out. I’ll join you both for our last one at 11:30.’

Jamie watched as the other two woman, including the red head who had lead him to the room, walked briskly away without even replying.

‘You may come back in now Mr Fuller’

Jamie slipped back into the board room wriggling on the chair shyly. He just hoped this wouldn’t take long as he desperately needed a piss!

It was impossible to get comfortable and at first Jamie sat with one leg over the other swinging his leg but then he quickly turned to the side then as discreetly as possible he scissored his legs in and out or swung them up and down. He knew how unprofessional he must seem but as every minute passed he craved to urinate stronger and stronger.

‘So is there anything else you would like to ask?’

Jamie swallowed hard, squirmed some more, slipped a hand into his crotch and crossed his legs again.

‘I do apologise but do you have a bathroom I could use please?’

‘If you remind me at the end I will show you on the way out.’

‘Thanks. Is there much longer to go may I ask?’

‘Not too long. So I just have some paperwork now. Let’s start with who your references are...’

Jamie could feel his face redden as he used his hand between his legs to squeeze his desperate penis. It was starting to hurt he had to go so badly and he knew his squirming was getting beyond acceptable now. In fact he couldn’t sit still as he wriggled again on the firm seat.

‘It’s a Mr. Shepherd from Infinity Beyond and a Ms Sharp from Wilderness Incorp. There addresses and details are on my CV.’

Jamie looked straight at the woman in front of him now. As she looked up from writing he stared into her dark green eyes as her curly blond hair rested neatly on her shoulders. His eyes pleaded with hers as he hoped she would see the urgency in his face as he bit down on his bottom lip and fidgeted restlessly. As a wave of intense urgency engulfed him Jamie leaned forwards and grabbed his quivering crotch before regaining his composure again and looking up.

‘Sorry. I really do need to use the bathroom please. Could I have a break at all?’

‘I said when we are finished! Please remain patient!’

Patience was the last thing Jamie felt as he bounced around on the seat now gripping the edges with both hands. With his body tensed and pressure mounting by the second he squeezed hard and drew a breath muttering softly, ‘I don’t think I can hold much longer!’

‘Mr Fuller! That’s enough! Either you wait or I will withdraw our offer of employment right now!’

No longer caring that he was disgracing himself Jamie opened his legs and hooked his ankles behind the legs of the formal chair as he pressed both hands over his throbbing aching crotch. As he tried to answer as quickly as possible the final questions he pressed, squeezed, rubbed and moaned openly as the woman peered at him open mouthed and wide eyed. Momentarily forgetting his surroundings due to the pressure and stress Jamie verbally answered the questions whilst unzipping his suit trousers and rubbing himself. The blond haired suited woman stared in disbelief at what she was seeing. Still Jamie couldn’t stop.

‘Shit! I’m dying for a piss! This is ridiculous. God I’m absolutely bursting! I’m actually gonna have an accident!’

The woman stood in silence, her eyes fixated on Jamie’s crotch, his fingers manipulating his half hard penis through his trousers and boxers and his palm massaging his member as his mouth opened and closed and his eyes glazed over. A soft moan could be heard through Jamie’s tightly clenched teeth as he felt a warm leak seep into his underwear and damped his trousers. He looked up aghast at the formally dressed female staring at him in shock as his eyes beseeched her to allow him to go to the gents to finish what he had accidentally already started.

‘Stop! I demand you stop that sir! Now!’

Jamie wanted to cry! ‘I’m trying! Honestly I am. Please please may I go to the toilet!’

‘Absolutely not!’

Shaking, angry, terrified and beyond bursting, Jamie half stood, half sat, both hands still clutching, twirling, clenching and squeezing his desperate dick as he hobbled forwards dribbling warm urine as his suit trousers fell clumsily down his thigh. Grabbing the jug from earlier, his bottom lip trembling, he pulled his aching cock out from the leg of his boxers as he held it into the clear jug as urine rushed into it furiously as the interviewer looked on.

‘Fuck!’

The jug filled almost to the brim as Jamie smiled relieved and placed it nonchalantly onto the formal board meeting table before making himself decent once again and smiling cheekily to the woman in front of him.

With his voice clear and solid for the first time he coughed and looked right at the suited lady.

‘So do I still have the Job?’

‘Absolutely! How soon can you start?’

I wonder what was the interview panel's motivation in this interview? At first I thought it was the redhead had a secret agenda. I was expecting her to take him aside to to tell him to hold his pee for her, maybe even taking him into a room to 'help' him keep his pee in.

And when he finally took the matter into his own hands, so to speak, what was their reaction, did they admire his desperation, him pissing, or the amount of pee he had had in his bladder?

And I wonder would the job require a strong bladder?

That’s the beauty of a good story. It often leaves you with many unanswered questions...
