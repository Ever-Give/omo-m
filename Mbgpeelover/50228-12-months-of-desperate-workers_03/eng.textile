Those final stories were fantastic, as was the whole series. Really enjoyed every single story, I’m hoping there’s still more to come in the future!

I’m already working on my next series of a stories and hope you enjoy them a small much as you did these. I certainly loved writing them...a lot!

So sad this series has finished but only because each and every one was so wonderfully written. What an author
