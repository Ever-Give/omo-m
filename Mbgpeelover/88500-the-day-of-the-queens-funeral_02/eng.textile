A mature female with her tomboy female friend and her female ex-bully watching her situation unfold while competing to see who would confess to her first and both are hiding the fact they also like to hold their pee and people watching them, not realizing that she knew about their crushes on her and was seducing them with her desperation and was turned on with being watched trying not to pee by them and masturbated about her fantasies of them watching her with lusty looks in their eyes in her bedroom at night and realizing that she had crushes on both of them also which is why she let herself get bullied by the bully because she was also a masochist and tried to get her friend to be mean to her, but the friend didn't want to thinking that her friend was suffering enough with the bully not realizing her friends masochism. is that okay with you?

I notice you edited this recently. I think your new ideas really complicate the story and confuse me a bit. I’ll do my best but it may not be up to your thoughts unfortunately. Please let me know if you still want this written with your original brief.

I read your second request too but that isn’t something I could write either. Sorry to disposing but I really need to be able to put myself into the characters and understand them to write and there’s some things that I am not comfortable with.
