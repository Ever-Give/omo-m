Ellen’s urgent need

Ellen didn’t know what to say when Daniel suggested she wait until they’d had their food. She was so busy concentrating on her own body, fighting the relentless pressure from her bladder and trying in vain to get comfortable. Crossing her legs wasn’t viable given the limited space in the car as she twisted and fidgeted thinking solely of getting to a loo as soon as she could. She stared up at the empty tower block facing her imagining just how many loos there must be inside which only frustrated her more as she blew out through clenched teeth and moaned under her breath. It hadn’t seemed so bad when they’d first arrived but now her desperation had increased exponentially. Looking at Daniel casually biting into his sandwich she had to say something before things became critical. Pushing the door open and lifting one leg out Ellen spoke quickly and decidedly.

“Actually Daniel I don’t really think I can wait until you have eaten. I really should have went in as we were passing. I’ll be super quick I promise! You wait here and keep eating. Honestly I will be fine.”

At that moment though she felt anything but fine as the movement of her leg and the opening of her thighs eased the pressure against her crotch causing a dribble to leak. Squeezing as tightly as she could she pushed her body back into the seat straightening her back to put pressure against her pelvic floor muscles. She knew Daniel had said something and he was getting out the car now but so preoccupied by the effort to not have an accident Ellen blocked everything else out as she scrunched up her long top in her sweaty hand and wedged a hand between her thick legs. She turned her head to see Daniel as she felt she had to say something. As he leaned forwards to help her out the car she finally confessed what she suspected Daniel had already worked out.

“I should have said earlier. I’ve been bursting for a wee for ages.”

The Daniel she knew well, who she’d worked with so much over the last year, seemed to suddenly change. No longer the quiet gent who barely spoke he seemed to turn into her biggest encourager, her knight in shining armour even, as he took her free hand and pulled her from the car before linking arms with her and almost carrying her to the shopping centre.

Walking was much harder now for Ellen as her gait became more of a twisted slow waddle but Daniel never left her side reminding her gently that she was almost there and willing her to make it. Seeing the glass entrance Ellen felt a strange mixture of relief yet panic. She was so close now yet neither of them actually knew if the centre had loos let alone where they might be. Trying not to cry with the sheer effort of holding on she tried looking around for signs but each spasm from her bladder made her squirm and flinch too much. It was only a matter of time. Her bladder ached for release and she was sweating trying to keep fighting against it.

When Daniel said the escalator was out of order and they needed to find a lift to floor three Ellen wasn’t sure where to put herself. From the little she’d seen of the centre so far it was quiet but she really didn’t want the embarrassment of having an accident in the middle of a shopping centre. The lift seemed to take forever to arrive even though in reality she knew it was less than a minute. Stepping in she checked no one else had joined them before pee dancing like she’d never done before. Shaking her leg, holding herself openly, bending forwards and finally pushing against the wall to tense her entire body, Ellen was beyond being embarrassed with Daniel. She was either going to embarrass herself acting like a 5 year old or embarrass herself and him by making a huge puddle. Not giving eye contact to Daniel or really noticing him at all she waddled out the lift as it finally reached level 3 praying that the toilets weren’t far away.

Daniel appeared to notice them first as he hooked Ellen’s arm again and lead her towards them. Something didn’t look right though as Ellen struggled to focus clearly enough to process what it was. There was something in front of the doors blocking them. What was it? As she cane within touching distance of the loos at last it became clear what the blockage was: a turnstile that needed a coin to work! Daniel had reached them first and Ellen took the final few steps with one hand deep between her legs.

The noise of the food court made hearing Daniel a struggle but Ellen guessed he was asking if she had any change. It was then that the realisation hit her: she’d left her purse back in the car at the tower block! Seeing the sign to the loo was torturous as Ellen steadied herself by sitting on a nearby chair in the food court. There was no way she could make it back to the car and back again nor could she even wait while Daniel went alone. Even if he ran both ways it would never be enough.

Daniel rubbed Ellen’s back then bent down to her eye level as Ellen wriggled on the hard aluminium red restaurant seat as their eyes met.

“I can’t wait any longer Daniel.”

“I can see that. It’s just…I don’t know what to do.”

With crowds of students close by eating and drinking and noisily waiting in the queue at Burger King Ellen placed her sweaty hand over Daniel’s on the well used table as her other hand gripped the side of the red chair tightly. Moving her chubby legs either side of the chair Ellen wriggled one last time before shuffling forward a little, letting go of the chair and holding her top up slightly. Looking right at Daniel with tears in her eyes they both heard Ellen moan quietly as liquid gathered all around the crotch of Ellen’s leggings, quickly spreading down the inside of her legs, pooling on the chair where she sat and pouring onto the floor. Ellen bit her lip feeling extremely self conscious and awkward as Daniel continued to rub her back soothingly. Hearing the urine now pouring quicker onto the tiled floor Ellen felt her cheeks redden. Surely everyone must be hearing what they were? Surely the entire food court would know that someone was weeing on the floor just by the toilets?

Daniel was still down on his hunkers as Ellen watched her urine run all around his smart shoes. She could still feel wee coming out though it did seem to be slowing at last. Looking back up to Daniel’s face she was amazed at how much he was smiling, how sparky his eyes were, how flushed his cheeks were. If she hadn’t of known better she might have thought he was extremely turned on by what had just happened. Feeling the warmth and wetness between her own legs she tried to suppress her own arousal despite feeling like she might burst with it all.

Feeling like she should say something all Ellen could mutter under her breath was, “I needed that so badly.”

Not sure what she expected Daniel to say or do next Ellen certainly wasn’t arguing as he leaned in closer and whispered horsely,

“And now I need this so badly too.”

He barely said the final word before their lips met for the second time that day, this time much more public and much more erotically as wee continued running slowly around their feet and under Ellen’s chair.

Ellen’s urgent need

Daniel’s urgent need

Daniel watched as Ellen raced to one of the empty food court seats as he wondered when the place was last cleaned. Worried for his colleague and friend he felt helpless to alleviate her struggle. What sort of shopping centre still required money just to access basic amenities? Frustrated but empathetic towards Ellen he bent down on his knees so he was level with Ellen who was still doing her utmost to hold on even though she said she couldn’t. Daniel could easily imagine how she was feeling thinking back to his childhood, teenage years at home and long days at work. Somehow though he also couldn’t help feeling a huge arousal watching the way this big beautiful woman wriggled and writhed on the hard seat. In so many ways it looked like she was bringing herself pleasure and that thought drove Daniel crazy.

Rubbing Ellen’s back partly in sympathy and partly in guilt at the pleasure he was secretly deriving from her situation he struggled to keep his own body from erupting as he stared in awe at the moisture erupting slowly between Ellen’s legs. Imagining her leggings and underwear no longer there he allowed his mind to visualise her big open and wet vagina with its moist red swollen lips, it’s hard and gorgeous clitoris and it’s exhausted urethra. Of course he’d never actually seen Ellen’s naked body for real but his imagination ran riot as the reaction in his own crotch was undeniable. 

Longing to touch Ellen in her most personal area he instead settled for the more polite and socially acceptable behaviour of placing his hand on the table. With Ellen’s large warm hand on his he used his other hand to rub her back hoping Ellen wasn’t too traumatised or upset by what was happening to her. His calf muscles ached but it was a small price to pay for being this close to Ellen as she gave in to the inevitable pressure and soaked her clothing and all around her.

Watching Ellen closely Daniel could feel her sheer relief, utter joy, and complete satisfaction of finally emptying her swollen overfull bladder. Her eyes shone even through the embarrassment of it all and her cheeks blushed. Her face the epitome of someone thrilled to have relief at last Daniel felt feelings for her way above what he’d experienced until now. He’d thought he’d fancied her before but right here right now he could make love to her ever so easily even lying in her own warm urine on the dirty floor.

As Ellen seemed delirious and in shock at just how much her body had ejected as the pool on the ground still grew under their feet Daniel hoped she was feeling the same way he was. As her eyes met his as her face rose up from facing the floor Daniel had the most urgent need to kiss this large beautiful amazing woman who had fought so valiantly against the pressure in her body for so long. Leaning closer he was seconds from kissing her when Ellen spoke with a hint of cheekiness and sass that reminded him of the meeting a few nights ago.

“I needed that so badly.”

Losing his normal self control and being led by his raging hormones and desires Daniel tried finding his voice though the words were more raspy and hoarse than usual. He hated being forceful and would never hurt Ellen but he had to kiss her as he leaned closer to her face and let their lips touch. That touch was enough as both of them craved so much more, oblivious to the crowds nearby as they embraced and kissed deeply. Struggling to stay on his knees now with both arms now around Ellen’s neck Daniel stood bent over practically sitting on Ellen’s plump knee. He hovered over it desperate to feel the warm wetness for himself but too terrified to mark his expensive beige suit.

It was Daniel who pulled away first now as his calf muscles and back ached from the angle he’d been at for so long. Returning to rubbing Ellen’s back fondly while he caught his breath he looked again at the running puddle at their feet knowing only too well that there was no way Ellen could meet his counterpart from Dundee council housing department the way she was. As if reading his mind Ellen flattened her top back down and used the table to help her stand up.

“I need to get my purse from your car Daniel. I need to get some new leggings or something before the meeting.”

Checking his watch for the time first Daniel had to think quickly.

“Maybe there’s somewhere in this centre you could get something quick? I’ll pay with my card. We’ve only got just over an hour. You’re not one of those woman who shops for hours though are you?”

Not stopping to think what she was saying Ellen replied quickly turning to start walking as she did so.

“Definitely not. I pick up most of my clothes from charity shops to tell you the truth.”

Not even processing what Ellen said Daniel turned to keep up with her as Ellen headed back towards the lift.

“Right let’s head for there then. They take cards right?”

Pressing for the button of the lift Ellen turned to smile at Daniel.

“Of course they do.”

Twirling around and examining herself now she spoke again.

“Is it obvious? You know…that I just peed myself? What if I keep my legs close together like this? Do you think everyone will know?”

Daniel smiled back. Ellen had done an impressive job of keeping her top dry and since it went half way to her knees and her leggings were black it wasn’t obvious at all what had just happened. Sure under her top her crotch must still be soaking and the inside of the legs of her legging must be sodden too but to a passer by or stranger and with her well endowed legs close together it wasn’t obvious at all. Daniel stared at her large breasts, a part of Ellen that never failed to lure him. Most men, he thought, would be so distracted by those they wouldn’t even look any further but he wasn’t sure how Ellen would react hearing that.

“You look absolutely beautiful. No-one can tell but let’s get you feeling fresher anyway.”

Taking her hand as the doors of the lift opened they walked into the lift alone again, this time without Ellen pee dancing in desperation.

*083*2023-06-13 23:46

Ellen shocks Daniel

Ellen was shocked and surprised when Daniel kissed her again though the minute their lips touched her entire body lit up. The warm wet feeling as the last drops of wee still came out into her pants only added to her arousal as Daniel’s tongue explored new area of her mouth eagerly. Ellen wasn’t afraid to be noticed in public but this was something else altogether as she had to fight the urge to unfasten Daniel’s shirt and explore even more of his delicious body. Thankfully for her Daniel pulled away, presumably because now he had stood up he was leaning so far down onto her that he was practically sitting on her knee. As he stepped back to get his balance Ellen heard his smart shoes splashing in the puddle of pee. The noise brought her back to reality with a bump.

Telling Daniel that she needed back to his car to get her purse so she could buy clean clothes from somewhere she panicked when he looked at his watch. She’s been so preoccupied with finding a bathroom that she’d forgotten all about the time. When Daniel offered to buy her something she felt embarrassed but grateful. She intended to pay him back as soon as she could but the most important thing now was finding somewhere that sold clothes her size and purchasing something in time for the meeting in the tower block. Knowing how few shops sold larger sizes combined with the fact she actually got most of her wardrobe from the charity shop she volunteered in every weekend she knew they had no time to waste as she headed straight to the lift again with Daniel coming behind her.

As Daniel continued making conversation Ellen couldn’t believe it when she blurted out that she got most of her clothes from charity shops. Imagining Daniel to be utterly horrified by this she quickly changed the subject by asking him if it was obvious that she had just weed herself moments earlier. She sure felt soaked beneath her loose long top but she had no idea how obvious it might be to others. Even if they couldn’t see the wetness surely they would smell her? Feeling self conscious and anxious her stomach filled with butterflies as Daniel so easily and naturally called her beautiful. That wasn’t something woman like her heard very often and especially not from smart sophisticated well dressed men like Daniel Omari.

Once again they were the only ones in the small lift which Ellen found surprising given how many people had been in the Burger King upstairs. Hoping that Daniel wasn’t just being polite and that no one would actually know of her accident Ellen stepped out the lift on the ground floor nervously holding Daniel’s hand for support. Now for the first time Ellen properly looked around at the tired looking centre getting worried by how many vacant units there was. Heading deeper into the centre away from the main doors she pointed out what looked like a small charity shop across the other side. It wasn’t a national brand that Ellen recognised but she pushed opened the small door hopeful they might have something in her size.

Heading towards the rear of the shop Daniel followed behind quietly. Ellen knew from her own experience that no one ever put the plus sizes near rather front as it was a smaller market and often put others off. Looking through the rails she past the smaller sizes quickly starting to lose hope. A member of staff was approaching her now and Ellen took a deep breath hoping he wouldn’t come too close.

“Can I help you?”

“Emmmm. I was just looking for your plus size clothes if you have any?”

The older man slid some clothes along the rail before stopping.

“This is all we have currently I’m afraid. There’s a few tops and cardigans just before the bookshelf there but we don’t get much in for plus sizes unfortunately.”

Ellen took out the first item on the rail and looked at it. A ghastly lime green flowery skirt that looked more like curtains in an old folks home. Sighting she hung it back up and looked at the next item: A dark brown coloured short sleeved loose fitting knee length dress. Ellen checked the size before holding it up for Daniel to see. It definitely looked like it would fit Ellen but her preference would always have been to have leggings underneath. Knowing it was extremely unlikely the small charity shop would ever have legging in at all let alone in her size she kept hold of the dress and headed past Daniel to where the older man had said there might be some plus size cardigans. 

After rummaging through the rail of mixed tops, jumpers and play size coats Ellen eventually came across a cream coloured cardigan. It reminded her of old ladies again but as she slid her arms in over her current top she nodded as it sat comfortably on her broad shoulders. Taking the items to the till Ellen looked back at Daniel who already had his wallet out with his cards ready.

Ellen had to laugh at the shock on Daniel’s face as the volunteer in the shop announced with a smile that the total was just £15. Obviously used to shopping in very different stores Ellen could no longer hold back an hearty laugh when Daniel whispered asking if he should add a tip onto it. He was so different to her but so innocent in his own way too. Leaving the shop promptly for fear of anyone knowing that Ellen’s legs were still wet with stale urine Ellen carried the bag back towards the centre doors as they headed back to Daniel’s car.

It wasn’t until they reached the car that Ellen realised there was a problem. She might have something clean and dry to wear now but she had nowhere private to change into them! As he opened the drivers door Daniel looked over at Ellen as she smiled nervously back.

“I assume you don’t want your car seat getting wet? We never thought about where I’d change did we?”

“Ah.” Looking into the car Daniel noticed the carrier bag that he’d sat his half finished sandwich on earlier to prevent crumbs on his seat.

“I can give you a bag to sit on while we have lunch at least.”

Daniel opened his door carefully lifting the sandwich and sliding the carrier bag onto the passenger seat. Ellen leaned down to pick her own unopened sandwich and drink up before sitting down onto the bag and closing the door. Worried the bag wouldn’t protect Daniel’s car enough she slid her shoes off, placed her lunch onto the dashboard and proceeded to immediately pull down her wet pants and leggings as Daniel stared at her wide eyed.

*084*2023-06-14 23:37

Daniel shocks Ellen

Daniel didn’t rate their chances of finding any suitable clothes shops in the centre they were in at all. So many of the units were empty and those that were occupied seemed to be full of discount shops he wasn’t familiar with at all. Thinking they would be much better off walking through the centre and out the other door or even going back where they were earlier by the art gallery he was glad that Ellen appeared to think the same as they walked hand in hand through the quiet shopping centre. When she pointed to a shop at first Daniel thought she just recognised the name but as she pulled him towards it it seemed much more like she intended going in. Maybe it was a larger ladies boutique shop or something that he wasn’t aware of?

Inside his eyes darted around trying to make sense of the layout. Instead of piles of neat clothing all of the same item in different sizes this shop had rails all around of what seemed like sale items. Wondering if it was perhaps a high street clearance shop he left Ellen to look as he watched her in fascination. She was such a natural at everything, confident, smart and funny too. When she held up a brown dress he smiled not sure wether she was planning to buy it or not. They didn’t have time for her to be picky so he was even more relieved when Ellen then found a cardigan and tried it on. It didn’t particularly flatter her curves but if that was what she liked he wasn’t in any mood to argue. As his stomach growled reminding him he still hadn’t eaten properly yet he pulled his wallet out ready to pay standing behind Ellen at the till.

His face must have reflected his thoughts well as Ellen looked at him laughing. Surely even a brand name discount shop wouldn’t be selling both a dress and a cardigan combined for just £15? When he queried it quietly with Ellen suggesting adding a tip incase they had made a mistake Ellen laughed. Despite the fact she was clearly laughing at his expense Daniel didn’t seem me to mind, revelling instead in the enjoyment and beauty of Ellen Hemmingdale being exactly the woman he fancied so much. As he scanned his card for the contactless payment Ellen took the bag and they quickly left.

Neither of them spoke on the short walk back to the tower block as Daniel looked forward to finishing his lunch at last before hopefully discussing some things with Ellen regarding the meeting. Unlocking the car as they approached Daniel was surprised to see that Ellen didn’t climb in right away, instead she stood looking at him over the top of the car nervously. When she mentioned why with a twinkle in her eye Daniel, ever the problem solver, noticed the carrier bag protecting his seat. Sliding it over to the passenger seat he was glad to see Ellen finally get into the car. Now at last they could eat and prepare for the meeting ahead, the reason they were here in the first place.

With his sandwich once again almost at his mouth Daniel was distracted by Ellen yet again. Turning to look at her he watched in awe as she held her bottom in the air and used both hands to pull down her leggings and her wet pants. Gazing at the wet clothing Daniel could feel his crotch stirring quickly again. He hadn’t really gone soft from earlier when Ellen had her accident and now he could feel the all too familiar swelling and growth once again. Ellen was now sitting in his car naked from the waist down, though her long top hid anything from her mid calf upwards. Daniel wanted to comment but he was too shocked and way too horny to trust himself to speak now. Still holding his sandwich out ready to bite he couldn’t take his eyes off Ellen as she shocked him ever further by leaning forward, pulling herself off the seat slightly then proceeding to pull her top over her head in one seamless movement.

Now sitting right beside him in nothing but her lace bra Daniel’s eyes almost popped out of his head. Her body was curvier, sexier, more attractive than he ever imagined. Even with her bra on he could clearly see her large erect nipples as he practically shook with desire. Ellen wasn’t even looking at him though as she leaned forward with her breasts on her knees as she dug into the bag to find the dress she had just bought. Finding the head hole Daniel watched transfixed as Ellen slid her broad arms into the short sleeves and angled the dress adeptly so the head hole easily went over her head. With her arms fully in now and her head right through the head hole she sat back smiling at Daniel who felt like a deer in the headlights gawping at her in amazement.

Pushing her feet right into the footwell of the car Ellen angled herself with her bottom in the air as she attempted to pull the dress down. The limited space in the passenger seat combined with Ellen’s size made the task impossible as Ellen began laughing heartily at herself as she turned to Daniel again.

“I’m not very good at this am I? I think I need more practice don’t you?”

Losing himself entirely in the moment, uncharacteristically for him, Daniel found the words tripping out his mouth before he’d even thought about them.

“I can help you strip off in my car anytime you want!”

Ellen, wether through embarrassment or shock at what he’d just said, laughed loudly as she tried in vain to get her dress past her bottom again, this time falling down onto the seat so much the car bounced. Daniel wasn’t very prone to laughing but Ellen’s giggling was contagious and he found himself laughing too.

“Do you make a habit of stripping off in people’s car then?”

“Cars, buses, trains, taxis, boats…all of them of course…it’s my party trick didn’t you know?”

Now he was losing himself even more as his whole body relaxed in the running joke.

“Always after wetting your panties like today I assume?”

Ellen was still laughing though a little less as she looked right in Daniel’s eyes.

“Nah. That bit was just an added bonus especially for you.”

“Why thank you very much madam. It was a wonderful bonus indeed.”

Ellen elbowed Daniel affectionately before looking down at her dress which was wrapped around her middle all scrunched up.

“I’m so professional aren’t I? Fancy helping me out?”

Winking at Ellen provocatively Daniel couldn’t resist.

“I’d much rather be taking it off you but seeing we have a meeting to go to and we are parked in a public place I shall oblige happily. Just this once mind.”

Ellen used the handle of the door and the side of her seat to haul her weighty body up as Daniel placed his sandwich between the seats and did his best to pull Ellen’s dress under her bottom and past her hips. He couldn’t resist feeling Ellen’s legs in the process as he longed to touch so much more of her. The dress wasn’t much longer in truth than her top as it only just reached the top of her knees. Seeing it on Ellen now Daniel was astonished at how perfect it was for Ellen, matching her brown hair perfectly and showing off her large curvy breasts to their fullest. Unlike the top she had on previously the dress was more fitted and shapely and even sitting in the car Daniel could tell it would show off Ellen’s body to its best.

“You look absolutely stunning in that.”

Ellen smiled and blushed a little.

“You know Daniel you have spoken more today alone with me than I’ve heard you talk all year. I’m in shock to be honest.”

Daniel picked up his sandwich again and this time took a bite and a drink of juice before replying. Since the kiss at the service station earlier things had progressed speedily but in less than an hour they needed to be strictly professional around each other. Ellen seemed calmer now too, finally opening her own sandwich and drink at last. They needed to both calm but he had one more thing to say first.

“You know I’ve fancied you for months Ellen. Every tine we worked together I got so nervous around you. I wanted to ask you out loads but there never seemed to be the right moment. Then when the boss never told you about this tower block stuff it just felt…awkward.”

“And here was me thinking you couldn’t get away from me quick enough some days. The second 5pm came you were always off like a shot.”

Daniel paused before finishing his lunch at last.

“Ah. There’s a reason for that. It wasn’t you though. That much is definite Ellen.”

*085*2023-06-15 21:29

Back to reality: Ellen

Ellen never saw herself as an exhibitionist in any way but scared to even breathe incase her wet clothing touched Daniel’s pristine car seat she pulled down her wet things rather than risk any damage. Her top was as long as many woman wore skirts so it wasn’t like she was exposing herself anyway. As she put the wet things on a pile at the footwell she saw the bag from the charity shop and figured she may as well now change fully since she was already half way there. At least then when she had to get out the car for the meeting she would already be suitably dressed.

Pulling her top off quickly and leaning forward so as not to embarrass or expose herself she slid her arms easily into the short sleeved dress and pulled it over her head. Having not actually thought things through fully it hadn’t occurred to her how she would get the dress past her waist and hips whilst still confined in the passenger seat of the car. Acutely aware that she now had no pants on and that Daniel was right beside her she did her best to pull the dress down as much as possible, hiding her embarrassment by mocking her own predicament.

Daniel clearly interpreted her comments as flirtatious as his reply made her blush with excitement. Not wanting to appear too keen or easy Ellen laughed heartily at the absurdity of it all. If someone had told her this morning that she’d find herself at quarter to two in the afternoon in Dundee alone in a car with Daniel with no knickers on and a dress rolled up under her bra she’d have thought them crazy. What would someone think if they found them right now? 

Trying one more time to pull the dress past her hips Ellen bounced down onto the seat like it was a trampoline, a matter that not only caused her to laugh again but Daniel to join in too. Hearing Daniel laughing it suddenly occurred to Ellen that it was a noise she’d rarely heard before. Daniel was the quiet one, the studious one, the reserved one. Not now though, not here in Dundee alone in the car with her. Here he was flirtatious, cheeky, humorous and relaxed and the more she saw of this side of him the more she really liked him.

Eventually admitting to the fact she needed Daniel’s help Ellen felt her whole body getting excited at the thought of Daniel touching her. As his fingers ran down her thigh as he gently tugged the dress down as she lifted her body up she knew she wanted so much more. The hairs on her neck stood up in excitement but now wasn’t the right time or place. Daniel was still complimenting her though and when she commented on the fact that it was lovely to hear him talking so much he still seemed as infatuated as ever confessing that he’d fancied Ellen for quite some time.

This was news to Ellen who had been vey hot on Daniel for just as long, if not longer, but his body language had appeared to indicate he wasn’t actually interested. There was still parts of Danial Amasi Ellen didn’t know about but she hoped in time he might reveal more. At least for now they both knew where they stood now as Ellen began wondering how they would continue seeing each other back in Glasgow when they both worked long hours.

Right now though as they looked out at the empty tower block and ate and drank in the car together they both knew they had more urgent business to attend to. When Daniel had finished his full bottle of juice and eaten his second sandwich he switched back to work mode almost instantly. Ellen followed his lead as she listened intently to his every word.

“I’ve just counted Ellen. 15 floors. I’m not sure how many flats will be on each floor but let’s say there’s 4. That would make 60 flats altogether. I know there’s a mix of two bedrooms and three bedrooms so let’s assume it’s half and half for now. That would make 30 two bedrooms and 30 three bedrooms so that’s 150 bedrooms. The last accurate figure I have from the ship was last Friday when there was 131 people on board still including babies and children. I was thinking we could start by going through the list of names together. I want to know if this tower block is 100% feasible before we meet the others. We need family groups, those who are single, any couples that sort of thing. We’ll know the exact numbers of the properties at the meeting but we really need to know our figures first.”

“Right. That makes perfect sense. I can help you with that. I seem to recall we did something similar months ago but things can change. There’s one or two still talking about returning to Ukraine too. I’ll mark them with a question mark for now.”

Ellen sat quietly as Daniel reached into the back seat for his briefcase. Opening it he pulled out some sheets of paper and some pens.

“It’s all hypothetical just now of course. The hard part is persuading them that this move is a good one.”

“I still need some persuasion myself too to be honest with you Daniel. I know what it’s like to keep moving around, to be uprooted when you just think you are settling. Even if this works on paper, which it probably does seeing the size of that tower, the reality might be quite different. This is people’s lives not numbers on a sheet. Some of these people have kids in schools to think about, or they have jobs or they have started colleges and stuff. It’s asking a lot of them to move this far away and start all over again. It’s a huge upheaval isn’t it.”

“But they don’t have much choice. We don’t have much choice Ellen. They can’t live on a cruise ship forever. They came here on the promise of somewhere to live. No one ever said that would be the town they landed in did they? This will cost Dundee city council millions. We need to show them these people are worth it.”

“I’ll do my best.”

“We both will. Now let’s start. First on the list is Yakiv and Mylana Abrahamovsky.”

“Yip. Young couple. She’s pregnant so we’ll need to ensure maternity care is transferred over. I’ll put them as a two bed. Next…”

Ellen was amazed that she could picture every person in her mind as they worked through the long list. Just as they reached the end of the list Daniel looked at his watch as two cars pulled into the car park.

“Just in time eh.”

“You ready Ellen?”

“I’ll just put my cardigan on then I’m good to go. We can do this Daniel. I’m keen to see inside this tower after all the time we’ve just spent looking at the outside.”

“Me too. Hope the lift works though!”

Back to reality: Daniel

While Ellen finished her own sandwich and drink Daniel attempted to count the floors of the tower block. All he’d been told from his colleague in Dundee was that it was one tower out of a set of four and that it had both two and three bedroom apartments. Emails had been exchanged by his boss regarding numbers who required housing so Daniel could only assume the tower block they were now parked at was sufficient to house them all. Doing some calculations out loud that appeared to definitely be the case but it all depended on the needs of the refugees. Even though this was a unique situation they still had to comply with laws regarding room occupancy so he hoped there were no larger families or extended families insisting on living together.

This was where having Ellen was such an asset as they worked their way through all 131 names on their list as Ellen described each person and their situation, not only recalling names but ages of children too. Daniel was in awe of her ability to remember it all though he knew only too well that she had become friends with more of them than he was professionally comfortable with. Right now though that knowledge was so useful as he did a final count of how many 2 and 3 bed places they needed. That number of properties would have taken years to become available in Glasgow as Daniel realised once again the significance of what Dundee city council was offering.

They had just finished and tidied the papers away when two vehicles pulled into the car park. Checking Ellen was ready Daniel stepped out the car with the papers and his phone in hand. It was spitting with rain again so he hoped they would be taken inside promptly to avoid his suit getting wet. Looking over at Ellen in just her new dress and cardigan he smiled at her thinking how lovely she looked considering she had only just bought her clothes an hour ago. As they walked closer to the four men now getting out the other vehicles at the entrance to the tower block Daniel felt a familiar feeling in his body. Putting it down to nerves he dismissed it as he held his hand out to shake his colleagues hand.

“Hi, I assume you are Keith? I’m Daniel Amasi and this is Ellen Hemmingdale from Shelter.”

“Great to put a face to a name finally. I’m Keith Bryan, housing officer for Dundee City Council. This tower here comes under my allocated area so I am delighted to tell you all about our plans. This is Craig Cuthbert from Construction Services and that’s Douglas and Rob from Claypots, our contractors. How about we head inside and I can tell you more?”

Daniel nodded as Douglas and Rob opened the security fencing as everywhere walked through. Keith then unlocked the heavy front door and held it open as the other five walked in. The entrance was clean, freshly painted and open. A set of two lifts stood in front of them with a large notice board on the wall behind.

“So, assuming there isn’t any wheelchair users among your clients we were thinking of keeping three of the four ground floor flats here for communal use. One, of course, will be for the caretaker. We can talk more about that later. The other two could be for anything you like really. Some initial ideas we’ve had could be having local community groups in to help everyone settle in or we have a money matters department who would probably be happy to cone in and ensure everyone is receiving any benefits they are due. We have a bank of interpreters we use who I could contact if necessary too. Anyway, I’ll show you the caretakers flat and then we can head to some of the other levels. If you follow me.”

Daniel followed behind Keith and everyone else keeping an eye out for Ellen who seemed genuinely impressed by the inside so far. The caretakers flat had clearly been recently modernised with a newly fitted kitchen and bathroom and freshly papered walls. Keith stressed that the contractors were on target to complete all 84 client flats from the first floor upwards to the same standard and that painting of the remaining stairwells and communal areas would be done as soon as the apartments were completed. Daniel took a mental note of the number of flats as he heard Ellen interrupting Keith.

“Would it be ok to take some photographs please? I know I’d like to see where I was being moved to before I went and I think it’s only fair our clients get the same courtesy.”

“Absolutely. Though please bear in mind that we haven’t finished everything yet.”

“Of course. Thank you.”

Daniel watched as Ellen lingered around the caretakers flat taking pics on her iPad of the kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms and lounge. As they left the flat she snapped more pictures of the entrance way, lifts, and even the notice board. Now she had found her voice there seemed to be no stopping her as she went on to ask about heating, security, local schools, colleges, community centres, sports centres, and even places of worship. Keith, Craig, Douglas and Rob patiently answered each question until Keith suggested they use the lift to see the view from the top floor. Rob stressed that these apartments had yet to be renovated and suggested Ellen may not want to take photographs of those. Ellen nodded as the large lift doors opened and all six of them piled in.

As they watched the floor numbers creeping up Daniel once again felt that same tingling he’d felt on leaving the car. The coffee this morning and juice at lunch were clearly making their way through his body. He never used the bathroom at work so it wasn’t like he wasn’t used to waiting and today would be no different.

Flat 15C was totally different to the caretakers flat with doors hanging off old kitchen cupboards, curtains falling down, torn wallpaper and bare floorboards. Daniel was very careful how he went, anxious not to get his suit covered in anything. Walking over towards the large lounge window Daniel heard Ellen gasp loudly.

“Oh my word! What a view! It’s like being at the top of a big wheel only so much better.”

Keith unlocked the veranda and Ellen walked out into the drizzle looking all around.

“People would pay a fortune in Glasgow for a view like this! It’s truly breathtaking.”

Daniel settled for looking through the window where he felt drier, cleaner and safer. Suddenly recalling the other three tower blocks he asked his colleague what was happening to them. It was Douglas who answered pulling out a blueprint from his pocket and opening it out. Pointing at it as he spoke he animatedly and eagerly talked about how the other towers were due to be demolished and in their place a community garden would be build with benches, flower beds and grass areas for children to play. Daniel looked up from the paper to see Ellen had joined them as she poured over the plans excitedly.

“So will this all be completed within the timescale?”

“Not within the next three weeks no. The demolition is scheduled for this Tuesday morning and then the rest of that week will be the clearing up. The ground will then need settled and flattened before anything else. I’m afraid the garden will be worked on still after our guests have moved in. We’ll keep disturbance as minimal as possible of course. I believe the press will get the announcement about our plans for Tulloch Court here on Monday so you might want to prepare your clients beforehand.”

Daniel looked at Ellen. Until this morning she didn’t even know anything about these plans and even he had to admit it appeared that Dundee City Council had had things agreed well before he was even told. Now they had just one week to talk to over 130 refugees, few of whom spoke English, and persuade them to move almost 100 miles away to live in a tower block in a new town before they heard it all second hand via the news. Even he had to admit that wouldn’t be easy.

*089*2023-06-17 18:20

Ellen longs to get back home

Once again Ellen found herself the only woman in the group. Looking around the inside of the tower block thought she had to admit it was nothing like she’d imagined. It smelled of fresh paint and the floor was cleaned and polished. The area was open, fresh, and airy and walking around it looked like there were actually 6 flats in total too which was more than Daniel had first thought.

Listening to what was being said Ellen felt excited in her spirit at the idea of communal areas where everyone could access support. She could easily imagine Oleksandr’s little one and young Ihor running about and perhaps the primary school kids getting help with their homework in one of the other flats. During the day the adults could be getting English lessons, or money advice or help understanding bills. The possibilities were so exciting and it would mean they could sustain so many of the friendships and community feel created living on the cruise ship but with much more personal space for each family.

Seeing the impressive caretakers flat Ellen could easily imagine herself living there. The kitchen was bigger and better laid out than her own small maisonette in Glasgow and the second bedroom was a large double unlike her tiny box room at home. Snapping away on her iPad taking pictures Ellen imagined herself showing Taras, Myroslava, Inna or Oleksandr back on the boat. Myroslava especially often talked about missing cooking a lot because on the cruise ship meals were all provided in the large dining area and seeing this kitchen Ellen knew she’d become quite emotional. Something like a kitchen that everyone just seemed to take for granted was huge to those on the ship and Ellen understood that so well.

Leaving the caretaker flat now and heading to the 15th floor Ellen gave eye contact to Daniel. It was strange seeing him revert back to his quiet professional demeanour after they’d been chatting, laughing and even kissing just moments earlier. Now he seemed nervous, distracted even, as the numbers on the lift slowly went up. Taking a quick photo of the lift as everyone stepped out Ellen noticed immediately that this floor was nothing like the ground floor. The layout of the doors to the flats was identical but the walls here were covered in graffiti, the flooring was torn and filthy and the whole place was dirty and dusty.

Flat 15C faced East and was bigger inside than the caretakers one they had just came from. Walking through the hallway into the lounge Ellen was struck by how musty this flat smelled but what got her attention even more was the view from the large lounge window. Taking another photo both from the window and from the balcony Ellen couldn’t resist taking a short video to really convey how fabulous the view actually was even on a cloudy drizzly day. She wouldn’t need an interpreter to translate this as she couldn’t help but comment on how much someone would pay for such a view back in Glasgow. She was so distracted by the sea and the skyline that she hadn’t noticed Daniel being shown some plans. Keen not to miss anything when she heard chatting she came back in to listen and look herself.

While it was just a plan on paper Ellen was incredibly excited at the prospect of a community garden. Outside space was always a priority for so many of the refugees and something she knew was sorely missed living on a cruise ship. It was a luxury many had to sacrifice in order to have a roof over their heads but now seeing plans in front of her Ellen couldn’t help but get a little emotional. Listening as the contractor explained how it would all come about Ellen now actually wished she could be here to watch the incredible transformation taking place. It was hard to imagine what the area would look like with the other tower blocks demolished which would also give a brilliant view from every angle of the building.

Querying the timescales Ellen looked at Daniel as he looked at her as Douglas explained the dates for demolition, the continued refurbishment of the tower and the renovation of the garden area. It all seemed so quick, so tight, but so exciting. All except for one thing that was: the impending public press announcement that Ellen knew would shock and disturb everyone still living on the ship.

They trusted Ellen now so if they were to hear that they were being shipped miles away to a tower block the other side of Scotland and she hadn’t told them first she’d lose that trust instantly. An entire year of building relationships would be destroyed overnight. Not only that but putting so many vulnerable people into the firing line of press attention would shake the entire refugee community. They had a right to know all she was hearing and seeing and be respected by being told rather than hearing it on the news.

No matter how lovely the flats were painted or how beautiful a community garden they had planned if the people on the Adventurer II felt Ellen had betrayed them it would all be in vain.

Ellen was itching to get back home now to start thinking of ways to inform and persuade her friends, hoping the photographs would at least help combined with the promise of a stable home at last. Assuming the plan was now to perhaps sign whatever was necessary before leaving for Glasgow Ellen was shocked when Keith suddenly announced something as they were walking down the hall of the flat back towards the lifts.

“So now you have seen Tulloch Court we can head back to my office at the council headquarters. There’s tea and coffee on offer and I I’ll dig out some biscuits so we can discuss exactly how many flats you require and what sizes and we can check local schools and nurseries for availability. I assume there’s children involved in this project given the size of properties that were requested? The more information we have the more we can, as a council and community, fully prepare for this. The funding is already in place so the more we can get organised now the better. We really want to give these guests a very warm welcome to Dundee.”

Daniel seemed equally as shocked at this, though he nodded willingly only asking if we could follow behind Keith since he wasn’t familiar with the city at all. Ellen had no choice but to go too and after all she did want to make sure everything was in place so she could reassure the refugees who were bound to have a lot of concerns.

It was a good job she had no one to be getting home to she thought as they all returned to the large lift again this time watching the numbers going door rather than up.

*090*2023-06-18 10:52

Daniel longs to get home

Daniel hoped that the tour of the tower block wouldn’t be much longer now. Surely if all the flats were the same layout there was no need to see them all? Keith seemed to have everything organised his end and the rest could be sorted via email now so once the contract was signed they should be free to start heading home. It was now almost 3pm and with an hour and a half minimum drive ahead, possibly longer if they hit rush hour in Glasgow then having to drop Ellen back at the dock yard first, he would be lucky to get home for 5pm. The twinges from his bladder were only slightly distracting at present but he knew only too well that he’d be very desperate by the time he got home.

Looking around the top floor flat again he noticed that everyone was now leaving which he was so relieved about. That was until Keith casually mentioned they were expected at the council offices to sort out some paperwork and discuss a few things. This wasn’t what Daniel wanted but there was no way he was going to ever say anything. Ever the professional he nodded as enthusiastically as he could muster and smiled. The only other problem was he didn’t actually know where the council offices were! On the way down in the lift Keith handed him a post-it note with a postcode, ‘in case we lose each other on the way.’ Daniel took it hoping not to have to use it but planning to put it into his satnav anyway. The last thing he needed this afternoon was to get lost!

Shaking hands outside the tower while Rob locked and secured the building and security fencing the six adults separated into the three cars, presumably all heading to the same place. Daniel waited for Ellen to belt up before turning the engine on, typing in the postcode quickly then pulling out the car park right behind Keith and Craig with Douglas and Rob behind him again. Copying every move of the car in front Daniel indicated and turned on cue. Stopping at a red light behind the council vehicle Daniel briefly turned to Ellen.

“I wasn’t expecting this. Were you?”

“Nope. In fact I was kinda hoping we’d have been heading home soon. Saying that they really are pulling out all the stops here aren’t they. Judging by the amount of work they have done already on that tower I’d say they’ve known about this a lot longer than we have.”

“I was just thinking the exact same thing. There’s no way that caretaker flat has been refurbished like that in a matter of days never mind all the painting and cleaning. Mind you if they have done that in a few days then it bodes well for getting the full tower done on time. Those time scales seemed awful ambitious to me.”

“You’re not the only one. Oh he’s turning right. Don’t lose him Daniel.”

Daniel focussed back on driving following the car in front closely as they edged through city traffic. The place was still jumping with students who seemed to fill every orifice of every building and still multiply like magic. Ellen seemed to understand that Daniel needed to concentrate as they wound their way through busy streets in the direction of the sea. Finally the council vehicle pulled into a small NCP car park and parked up. Daniel parked next to them and saw the contractors van park right across in his rear view mirror. As they all exited their vehicles again Daniel looked around searching for a pay machine but Craig appeared to read his thoughts. He hadn’t spoken much until now but as he typed something on his phone he nodded to Daniel and Ellen.

“That’s all three vehicles paid.”

Keith thanked him before leading the way into the large imposing building. Dundee house was much more modern inside than out as Craig signed everyone in at reception as Keith led the way into yet another lift. Daniel tapped his leg absentmindedly as this slower but more comfortable lift took them all up 4 flights. Following the others down a corridor they were ushered into a large office room where an urn was sitting on a table with sugar, milk and mugs close by. A plate of wrapped biscuits was next to it as everyone found a seat.

Daniel really didn’t feel that adding any more liquid to his bladder was helpful but not wanting to appear rude or ungrateful he found himself agreeing to a coffee regardless. Ellen agreed to a tea and with everyone now with hot beverages of their choice in front of them Keith finally got down to business.

“So what did you think of Tulloch Court then?”

Daniel was glad that Ellen spoke first in her usual confident manner. She echoed his thoughts exactly while hinting that they must have been working on it for some time. Of course neither Keith nor Craig responded to that part instead lapping up the praise easily. Then came the questions, as predicted, as the next hour passed in a blur of in-depth discussions around the practicalities of moving over 130 people across Scotland to resettle. Daniel found himself changing position frequently as he drank his coffee politely, crossing his legs at his ankles and pressing his hand casually on the top of his leg more than once or twice.

It was quarter past 5 before Ellen and Daniel left the meeting. Standing up to leave the room Daniel felt his penis tingle and throb. He hadn’t been to the toilet since leaving his home at 8am that morning and he really needed to go now. There was just no way he could bring himself to ask if he could use the gents before leaving though as the thought alone made him blush and shiver. Shaking hands again he let Ellen sign them both out as he headed to the car anxious and sweating.

*091*2023-06-19 13:58

The journey home: Ellen

The drive to Dundee House wasn’t long but the meeting dragged on. The council clearly wanted everything to go as smoothly as possible, for which Ellen was grateful of course, but it came across at times as all show and no substance. Ellen couldn’t help but worry that when the media shine was no longer on this ‘wonderful benevolent council who came to the rescue’ that support would soon dwindle and the refugees would be left on their own with little to no support. While everyone agreed that support had to be there not for the refugees to come to rely on but to prepare them for independence Ellen knew only too well that these were vulnerable people who mostly didn’t speak the language, who had been through traumatic life changing events and who were now being uprooted suddenly all over again. They would need support for quite some time before it could be phased out.

Ellen pushed the council to make sure there was a full multiagency approach, that every single apartment in the tower was completed to the highest standard including flooring and decoration and that there was definitely adequate other provisions in place like nursery places, school places and that the local GP surgeries could cope with the extra patient load. Being reassured that until 6 months or so ago all four towers had tenants in most flats and therefore all local amenities were more than able to cope Ellen felt a bit more settled. 

Glancing at Daniel she noticed he looked uncomfortable and distracted. He wasn’t talking much at all, even less than normal, and every time Ellen glanced towards him he was restless. Assuming he might just be tired she was glad when the meeting finished and the contracts were signed. Having now seen the tower block for herself Ellen was convinced this was, at least for now, the best option those on the cruise ship had. It wasn’t her signing the contract though though Daniel seemed overly keen to get it signed and handed over too.

Daniel remained quiet and distracted in the lift back down as well as while Ellen signed them both out. Walking quickly to the car Ellen struggled to keep up with him as she realised it was cooler now than when they arrived and beginning to get dark too. What was originally supposed to have just been a morning had very quickly stretched to the entire day and Ellen was incredibly grateful for the fact she had a lift home in Daniel’s car.

Daniel started the car quickly before Ellen had even belted up as he put the car into reverse and followed the sat nav direction out onto a main road. Ellen watched the sat nav in silence as Daniel drove, her mind thinking back to all the events of the day. As they drove down Hawkhill then joined Perth Road Ellen looked out the windows as they passed Dundee University wondering if any of the refugees might one day end up there.

Daniel was still quiet like his mind was elsewhere and Ellen initially didn’t want to disturb him as he drove in the rain on unfamiliar roads. Perth Road seemed to last forever but finally they turned and joined the A85 duel carriageway then left at a roundabout and finally onto the A90. According to the sat nav this appeared to go on for several miles so Ellen decided it was now safe to talk.

“Well at least I can say I have been to Dundee now. You know for all I didn’t want to come this morning I am so glad I did. That tower block was totally different inside to how I imagined.”

“Yeah.”

“Do you seriously think they will get every flat ready on time? That bit really worries me to be honest.”

“Depends how many are on the job I guess.”

“ I suppose. Daniel will you do me a favour and keep on top of them? I’d hate to make promises to everyone that I can’t keep. What was that we worked out again? 68 flats wasn’t it? I suppose that leaves a whole floor and a half that we don’t need, though I guess they really need to do those too for the scatter flats they are keeping for themselves. It sounds like they have most of those filled already too. You know another thing I am still worried about? That caretaker stuff. I know how slow you councils are at recruiting folk. I takes three weeks just to agree on the wording of any adverts never mind interview and select someone. I wouldn’t want to live in a tower that size without a caretaker, would you?”

“Mmmmm. No.”

Ellen looked at Daniel as he drove on the busy A road. He was tense looking, stressed looking, and he seemed to be lost in his own thoughts.

“Are you ok?”

“What? Of course I am. I…I just have a lot on my mind.”

“Sorry.”

“I didn’t mean to snap like. Oft I’m sorry. It’s just I’m…I’m a bit tired.”

“Maybe we should pull over somewhere and take a break then? It’s not safe to drive tired. Actually I could do with a wee stretch of my legs too. That meeting dragged on didn’t it.”

“No! Let’s not stop eh. The traffic is bad enough and I really want to get home. Keith should never have assumed we could be delayed like that. “

“As long as you are sure?”

Ellen looked out the window feeling like Daniel was sounding snappy. He probably was tired. It had been a long day and he’d done all the driving so was it any wonder he was grumpy and tired now? The problem was that she hadn’t just suggested a break because she wanted to stretch her legs. The bottle of juice in the car at lunch time combined with the mug of tea in the meeting were making her need to pee again. According to the sat nav they still had over an hour to go before they reached Glasgow. She’d have to just wait until home which hopefully wouldn’t be too much of a struggle. The traffic was busy but it was flowing well. So as long as it continued like that it should all be fine.

Feeling her damp leggings still at her feet from earlier Ellen looked out the front windscreen thinking. If only the others in the meeting in Dundee had known she was sitting there with no knickers on. That thought turned her on a little as she heard Daniel shifting in his seat again.

That was when she suddenly realised that she had been with him all day long and not once had he used a toilet or even hinted at requiring one. Either he had an enormous bladder or he was too embarrassed to mention it. Turning to look at him it was suddenly obvious why he was snappy and distracted. Sitting in the drivers seat right beside her Ellen could clearly see how tight his suit trousers now looked and how distended and swollen his bladder looked. Why he wasn’t wanting to stop for a break now was a mystery to her. He must be absolutely dying for a wee. Just thinking about it made her nipples hard and tingly and her heart beat faster.

*092*2023-06-19 23:59

The journey home: Daniel

Wishing Ellen would walk faster Daniel was in the car, seatbelt on and sat nav pressed to home before Ellen even got in. Didn’t she know they had a long journey ahead of them and every minute counted? Reversing out the parking space and then driving out the car park Daniel concentrated carefully on listening to the satnav trying his best to ignore the constant pressure in his crotch and bladder. He’d driven home from work many many days aching to piss and seriously wondering if he’d make it but this was fundamentally different for two reasons: firstly he wasn’t alone so that meant grabbing himself wasn’t really appropriate and secondly he wasn’t close to home by any description. Combining both these stressed Daniel so much as he found himself being snappy and grumpy whenever Ellen spoke to him.

He hated himself for being like that but the pressure in his bladder was constant and being so restricted by driving wasn’t helping one bit. Thankfully Ellen seemed to understand, or at least he hoped she did after he brushed off his moodiness by saying he was tired. In one way he genuinely was: he was incredibly tired of fighting against his body’s need to urinate. The last coffee in the meeting had been the final straw. What possessed Keith to think he could just keep them back so much longer when he’d already delayed then hours? It wasn’t like he’d even mentioned a meeting before but simply sprung it on them both giving them no choice really.

City traffic was both annoying Daniel and helping him. The fact it was delaying him even longer getting home and using the toilet was incredibly frustrating but having the ability to change positions and wriggle his body at lights and junctions was definitely helping keep his bladder at bay. Once on the A90 Daniel had to focus with everything he had as the traffic moved faster and the volume of traffic increased yet again. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the sound of Ellen’s voice or want to hear her talking. Ordinarily he loved nothing more but now her every word was distracting and difficult to process as Daniel clenched his buttock muscles tightly as another strong urge to piss almost overcame him. Wriggling a little on the seat and struggling to find a position that eased the urges was such a struggle as he hoped Ellen wasn’t aware of his predicament at all. The thought she might find out mortified and embarrassed him so much.

When Ellen suggested stopping for a break Daniel almost crashed the car in shock! That was the last thing ever he wanted to do as he knew only too well that his shy bladder would never allow him to release anything in a public toilet. He’d then have to return to the car even more desperate than he’d left risking Ellen realising there was a problem. The sooner they got to Glasgow the better for everyone! Seeing signs for Perth at last Daniel knew he’d already made it almost a third of the way home.

As he joined seamlessly onto the M90 he continued following the signs towards Stirling as the satnav directed. The entire time he could feel his suit trousers cutting into his bladder as he rubbed his upper thigh desperately every opportunity he had. He longed to squeeze his dick, push against it and move a lot more to help but with the seatbelt on, the fact he was driving plus the fact Ellen was right beside him he had to rely almost exclusively on his will power and concentration to hold back the torrent of liquid that bounced inside his bladder. It ached having has bladder so swollen as he tried desperately not to think about pissing or toilets of any sort.

Ellen had been quiet for a while but as the stretch of morotorway was coming to an end and signs indicated the miles to major cities like Dunblane, Stirling, and Glasgow, she started chatting once again pointing out something Daniel really didn’t want mentioned.

“Oh Daniel look! There’s a services coming up. Isn’t that the one we stopped at coming the way? I think we should stop again don’t you?”

Daniel could feel his face reddening though he hoped his dark skin might hide it from Ellen. Then Ellen did something that caused his body to jump involuntarily as he held the steering wheel tightly to keep the car under control. Gently, affectionately, she stroked the top of his leg as she carried on talking.

“We could always…you know…kiss again. Maybe this time we could actually go inside that McDonald’s and even perhaps grab a bite to eat? We’re already late home and I’m getting hungry. What’d you reckon?”

Feeling Ellen’s hand on his upper thigh millimetres from the tip of his aching penis was too much of a shock to Daniel as he felt dribbles of warm liquid leak into his tight boxers. Squeezing tightly he sucked air through gritted teeth as the extreme urge to piss more almost overwhelmed him. Pushing his left foot firmly onto the floor of the car he pushed his body back into the seat straightening his back as he fidgeted the best he could given the restrictions he had. It wasn’t helping much and Ellen still hadn’t removed her hand. In fact he swore she’d even moved it a tiny bit nearer his swollen manhood that was hard with the extreme need to pee.

“I’ve…I’ve got dinner at home. There’s…mmm….nicer places we can…em….kiss too. I really need to keep going. I hope you…gasp…understand.”

As the roundabout approached with Broxden services at the third exit Daniel indicated to take the first exit and slip road to the A9. Joining the duel carriageway with the chance to stop now behind him Daniel began wondering if he’d made the right decision.

“Of course. If your sat nav is accurate we’ve only got an hour or so now until home. My stomach can wait that long. It was just a thought. I’d probably have had a wee if we’d stopped but an hour isn’t long to wait is it?”

Daniel groaned. Every second was torture right now let alone an hour! Trying to refocus on the road Daniel took deep breaths as he now bounced his left leg up and down while his right leg remained down on the accelerator. Ellen’s hand was still gently rubbing his upper thigh as Daniel had a sudden brain wave. His thoughts clouded by the sheer urgency for release he removed his left hand temporarily from the steering wheel as he rested it on top of Ellen’s on his thigh before quickly but gently guiding it so it was now on top of his penis. Very briefly smiling at Ellen he quickly returned to looking out the windscreen and mirrors to safely drive as he couldn’t help but twist his crotch a little in the seat.

“You sure I’m not distracting you Daniel?”

“Oft definitely not darling. In fact that helps me drive more than you would ever know.”

Daniel finally tells Ellen something

Ellen sat quietly in awe watching Daniel. His every move captivated her and drew her to him as she imagined the pressure he must be enduring and the self control he was expressing. Why hadn’t he mentioned that he needed to wee badly? It was only the two of them in the car so why be so shy?

As they travelled along the busy A90 then onto the M90, passing lorries easily, Ellen spotted a sign that made her heart jump. They were almost approaching the very same services they had stopped at coming the way, the very car park where they kissed for the first time. There was something magical, romantic even, about there and she longed to relive that moment. As much as she was getting rather excited watching Daniel struggle she also hated the idea of him being in pain so stopping would also allow him an opportunity to relieve himself too. Suggesting they maybe stop for dinner Ellen knew instantly that Daniel didn’t appreciate that thought at all as he practically shouted at her about having food at home. Ellen could only imagine the stress he was under though as she worried he might actually explode with the pressure.

Watching Daniel’s tense and anxious face Ellen’s heart went out to him. Wanting to reassure him and comfort him she reached out her hand gently to rub his thigh affectionately. She hadn’t meant to startle him but the way he suddenly tensed and pushed back in the seat and wriggled frantically whilst still driving told her she definitely had. Feeling guilty she kept her hand in place gently rubbing hoping Daniel would know she was only trying to support him. Looking at the roundabout in front of them to make sure Daniel was still safe to drive she watched as he indicated for the first exit and continued onto the A9 completely bypassing the services.

Was Daniel crazy? Even a child would have been able to tell he was absolutely bursting for the loo right now yet he’d just passed up the opportunity to go. Ellen’s heart was pounding with adrenaline, her hands clammy and her body moist as Daniel carefully slid his left hand off the steering wheel resting it gently on top of hers before moving her hand just a little until she could feel his very swollen penis under her sweaty palm. Ellen shivered a little with excitement as she gently rubbed the end of Daniel’s manhood through his suit trousers the same way she had been rubbing on his thigh. Was Daniel getting just as much of a thrill from having to wee badly as she was watching him? Checking she wasn’t distracting him from driving her stomach did a loop to loop when Daniel smiled as he controlled the car professionally as he now spoke clearer and stronger than before.

“Oft definitely not darling. In fact that helps me drive more than you would ever know.”

Darling? Daniel had never called her that before as Ellen felt she might scream in hysteria. Ever mindful of the fact Daniel was driving combined with the fact he was yet to even suggest or hint about needing to pee she gently rubbed her hand over his hard penis as she felt his body tense and squirm around her. Her own body was warm and fluttery as she now worried about her lack of pants sensing her own privates warming and getting wetter. If she continued rubbing Daniel she feared her own body might overreact which would pose a huge distraction for Daniel. As much as she was loving the thrill of what was happening she had to be practical and sensible.

“You will tell me if this is too much won’t you? I mean you are driving on a busy A road in the early evening in drizzly rain. Are you sure we shouldn’t pull off somewhere.?”

Ellen continued gently swirling her fingers and pressing the tip of what she could tell was Daniel’s erect penis. She could feel it moving under her fingers both responding to her touch but also, she assumed, snaking with the urge to let out urine. Before Daniel answered his whole crotch tensed again and his left leg shook.

“I’m fine honey. Please please don’t stop.”

Swallowing nervously Ellen wanted to say something but decided to wait as Daniel lurched forwards quite suddenly pushing his hand firmly on top of hers and pressing down hard with his whole hand. Ellen had to say something now before they had an accident. She really liked Daniel an awful lot but he wasn’t safe to drive like this any longer. Wether he agreed or not she had to be firm and make him stop at the first available opportunity whenever that appeared. Scanning the dark road for any signs of services she took a big breath in as Daniel finally moved his own hand away.

“Look Daniel you seem very distracted. I really think you need to pull into the next services. Even if you don’t want to eat I need a wee and you need a break. Are you sure you are ok?”

Shuffling on his seat breathlessly Daniel took a moment to answer.

“I’d rather just go straight home.”

Ellen left his words hanging for a minute as she looked at Daniel from head to foot. His hair was damp with sweat, his neck tense and warm. His heart was beating fast, his lower back wedged tight into the seat and his legs were taut and shaky. His middle was swollen so much his trousers were stretched tightly across his full bladder and he could barely sit still even with a seat belt on. Home was still at least 50 minutes away now and it was blatantly obvious to anyone that Daniel would never last anywhere near that long. Wondering how to broach the elephant in the room Ellen squeezed Daniel’s penis as he grabbed his own thigh with his left hand and squeezed himself so hard Ellen thought he must have left a mark. If he carried on much more his entire driver’s seat would surely be soaked.

Enough was enough.

Speaking softly and gently Ellen moved her head as close to Daniel’s as she could trying not to distract him from driving any more than he already was. Whispering she hoped he would drop the macho defence finally and confess his predicament.

“There’s no shame in needing a wee. It’s ok to have to pull in somewhere and go.”

Daniel whispered back, his voice quiet and hoarse.

“I’m…I’m trying to wait until I get home.”

Ellen pushed a bit more making sure the traffic was still flowing fine. Still whispering even though it was only them in the car as she squeezed again with her fingers as Daniel whimpered.

“I guessed as much but it’s too far. You look like you are bursting to go.”

“I….oh shit….”

Now speaking at normal volume Ellen squeezed more as the tips of her fingers now felt warm and wet. Knowing why her entire body tingled as Daniel squirmed tearfully.

“It’s…it’s just a leak. I can make it. I can make it.”

“Would it help if I undid your trousers?”

“Oh God yes!”

Ellen leaned as close as her seatbelt would allow as she undid the top button of Daniel’s beige suit trousers and unzipped the fly sliding her hand inside to grip his penis feeling his warm wet underwear clinging to his erection. While she did so she felt she had to say something.

“You have to promise me you’ll pull over as soon as it’s safe. Even if it’s just a lay-by. Ok?”

“Ok. But don’t stop squeezing me. You promise? I’m fucking dying for a piss Ellen. I’ve been bursting since we were at the tower block!”

“Seriously? That was hours ago! I need a wee too but good grief I could never hold for that long. You should have said Daniel. We all need to wee. I mean I couldn’t even hold on at lunchtime let alone until now. I’ll do whatever it takes to help you. We can’t both wee ourselves on this trip eh.”

“Squeeze me hard Ellen! Harder!”

Thanks everyone. I write these chapters with my own bladder full and get a lot of pleasure from writing them and thinking about the story. Next chapter will be up tonight and in preparation I am consuming plenty water.

Daniel’s reliance on Ellen

Even with Ellen’s hand gently rubbing and pressing on his hard-on Daniel still couldn’t get comfortable at all. The pressure was tremendous as each spasm from his bladder threatening to make his dick erupt involuntarily. While the A9 was busy in both lanes Daniel was grateful that the road was primarily straight as he wriggled and tapped his leg furiously. Being able to stay in fifth gear at least meant his left leg was free to move even if his right one wasn’t. Having Ellen pressing on his crotch was helping but still he felt like he would explode any second.

He definitely didn’t need any more distractions as he concentrated fully on keeping his muscles closed and driving safely. As long as Ellen kept rubbing and pushing against the ever so sensitive tip of his dick he might just make it home. When Ellen yet again commented on the fact he looked distracted and suggested pulling over it really touched a nerve. Did she not think him capable? He wasn’t a young child unable to control his own body. He was a grown adult in a professional job who would pee as and when he decided to not when someone else said so! He could make it home. He knew he could. Wriggling more he struggled to talk with every word meaning he had to pause concentration just to speak.

“I’d rather just go straight home.”

As if taunting him and mocking him his body responded immediately by sending such a strong urge that forced Daniel to bend forwards and use his left hand to squeeze his upper thigh hard to distract his mind from the pain and urgency elsewhere. Ellen seemed to respond by squeezing the tip of his member and between the squirming and squeezing the wave finally passed and he made it through…just. Knowing the next wave would be stronger again Daniel bit his lip as his back dripped with sweat.

Of course Ellen had to know exactly what was wrong with him by now. He may as well have a neon flashing light announcing it to the whole world but yet actually saying it still seemed impossible. It was a deeply private matter and one that Daniel preferred keeping that way. To Daniel it was exactly like having an erection: If the actual words were never said then he could somehow pretend to himself that it wasn’t happening. Denial had always served him well over the years from living at home with his strict mum to his high school days of avoiding the school toilets. Even though now it was only Ellen and him in the car the words just refused to come out. Saying it in Daniel’s eyes was allowing his brain to acknowledge it which would only make holding 100 times harder. Even hearing someone else saying it would be awful and dangerous right now.

It was as if Ellen Hemmingdale had read his mind and she was deliberately goading him as she leaned nearer his face and whispered seductively.

“There’s no shame in needing a wee. It’s ok to have to pull in somewhere and go.”

To Daniel she may as well have said there’s no shame in having a hard on and having to pull in to masturbate! Wasn’t it deemed exposure in either case? Some things should only ever be done behind closed doors and urinating and sex were up there for Daniel. Of course Ellen would never understand, nor could she ever empathise with the urgent desire he felt right that second for both! Having such a beautiful amazing and curvy woman fondling his tender sensitive and ever tingling penis was torture and ecstasy in equal measure. The very millisecond he got home he’d burst with rivers of pent up urine then immediately cum from the very sensations he was feeling right now. With every fibre of his being he longed to piss so badly but with every sexual orifice of his body he longed to be inside Ellen too. Her words sent shivers up his spine as hearing her confirming what his brain was struggling to acknowledge seemed to connect them as if they were one.

She wouldn’t understand. She couldn’t possibly know the double meaning behind the words. Breathlessly, hoarsely, through gritted teeth, he forced his mouth to form words.

“I’m…I’m trying to wait until I get home.”

Now Ellen was taking him to his absolute limit as she pressed and rubbed his hard-on like she actually wanted it to burst! Daniel whimpered unable to ask her to stop but feeling he no longer had any control as he looked out the windscreen and mirrors as he drove on a busy duel carriageway while someone was alluring him sexually in ways he’d never known possible all while in an excruciating urgent need to piss! Everything Ellen now said seemed to carry a double meaning as she commented that home was too far away to wait and he was clearly bursting to go. Fuck she was hitting the bullseye with both her words and her actions as Daniel felt heat rise from the tip of his toes right through every vein into his hot sweaty face.

It was all too much as warm liquid coursed down the length of Daniel’s member and spurted out uncontrollably. Unsure if he had cum or leaked pee Daniel panicked panting that it was only a leak and repeating to himself that he could still hold. Unable to look or even feel how bad the damage was Daniel was nervous as he knew from experience that if it was piss he had just leaked that it might just be the beginning of the end. Panicking he tried refocusing back on driving in an attempt to ignore what had just happened hoping the darkness outside would hide everything.

Still absolutely bursting but buzzing with excitement and adrenaline and unbelievably turned on still he scanned the road ahead for any signs of a lay-by or service area. In the state he was in he worried his concentration at the wheel might lapse any second and he knew only too well how dangerous that could be. His bladder ached now so much and he was in such a heightened state already that when Ellen suggested undoing his suit trousers he instantly agreed believing it would allow his bladder to expand more and increase his ability to hold back.

Daniel had to hold his breath as he tensed his whole body as he now realised that Ellen would have to temporarily let go of his penis to undo his trousers. Thankfully she was super quick but those seconds were almost fatal as more warm liquid sped instantly down his dick threatening to escape. Ellen unzipped his fly and slid her hand down gripping him tightly just in the nick of time. The feeling of a woman squeezing him and rubbing him through his own warm wet boxer briefs was heavenly as Daniel gripped the steering wheel tightly to stop his hands from touching Ellen.

Was this what it felt like being tied up, helpless to move your hands whilst a big beautiful sexy woman had her way with you? Daniel’s mind filled with sexual thoughts towards Ellen as her hand was now the only thing both preventing him wetting whilst simultaneously driving him sexually in sane. He was dying to cum but more than that, much more than that, right this minute he was so fucking bursting to piss he could hardly stand it.

Very aware of Ellen yet equally encased in his own world in order to keep control of his body Daniel heard Ellen speak but it took a few seconds to process it.

“You have to promise me you’ll pull over as soon as it’s safe. Even if it’s just a lay-by. Ok?”

That was exactly what he was going to do anyway but in order to get there safely and in a dry car Ellen needed to help him. It was time she heard just how bad things really were.

“Ok. But don’t stop squeezing me. You promise? I’m fucking dying for a piss Ellen. I’ve been bursting since we were at the tower block!”

Daniel heard Ellen replying but as he was fighting another powerful spasm he couldn’t process a single word. He could feel it rising again more powerful than ever…

“Squeeze me hard Ellen! Harder!”

Thankfully she did just that as Daniel squirmed and took deep breaths facing out the front windscreen the entire time. There had to be a lay-by soon or even better some services. Things were more urgent than ever now. If only this was a motorway with a hard shoulder he could pull onto and not a duel carriageway at rush hour on a Monday evening!

With Ellen massaging, squeezing and pinching his head with her fingers and often touching his testicles too Daniel knew he owed her everything. If it wasn’t for her intervention, her kneading and squeezing and understanding he knew he’d be sitting in a pile of his own piss mortified and humiliated right now. He’d be sure to thank Ellen as he distracted himself by thinking up lovely ways to do so.

“Daniel! Daniel! Look! Finally! Can you see it? Thank goodness. At last. Pull into that petrol station honey. And don’t even think about lying to me that you’ll make it home honey. You’ve done incredible to hold this long. I’m so proud of you honey. So unbelievably proud of you!”
