An unforgettable scene

It was a pretty normal day. The weather was drizzly, work was uneventful, and the wife was having another one of her work from home days. Since the whole Covid stuff her work have been asking her to do that more and more. Not that I mind as I’m usually out most of the day myself, but this particular day I happened to finish earlier than usual so I headed home looking forward to a hot coffee and the dog greeting me like I’m his long lost friend as always.

What I didn’t expect was to be greeted by a totally unforgettable scene that I still can’t get out of my head.

I knew Donna was working in the dining room so I quietly opened the front door, made a big fuss of the dog, then took off my coat and shoes. Gasping for a coffee I walked through the lounge (with the dog hot on my tail!) past the dining room where I could see Donna sitting at her laptop, then right into the family kitchen where I filled the kettle and switched it on. Automatically thinking to check if Donna wanted a cuppa I turned to look into the dining room to ask her when I remembered that she was on the phone. Deciding to just make her a tea anyway I made both mugs and carried them both through, pausing in the dining room to quietly slide Donna her mug over.

That was when I first noticed my wife looked very tense. She was sitting awkwardly on the dining chair, sort of leaning forward towards her laptop but with her thighs tight together and her back rigid. She caught my eye briefly so I pointed to her tea and left her to it assuming she was maybe dealing with a difficult client or something. Taking my own coffee over to the siting area I opted for the comfy armchair and placed my mug on the nearby table. Determined to respect Donna while she was still working I picked up the newspaper I’d started before work and began reading it quietly. The dog quickly settled back in his basket and I was just reading about the price of stamps increasing again when I was disturbed by the noise of Donna shifting on her seat.

Naturally I looked over to see her fidgeting around which was most unlike her. She was still talking to someone but then she suddenly stood up and crossed her legs which caught my attention right away. We’ve been married almost 15 years but this behaviour was most unlike Donna, who is the most ladylike, professional, conservative woman you could meet. Even working from home she still insists she dresses the part so she had on her navy pencil skirt, light blue silk blouse, nylon tights and her hair was all tied back with little wisps hanging either side by her ears. I took a quick sip of my coffee but my mind was far more on my beautiful wife and the way she was behaving.

Now as I looked over again she was back on her set swinging both her legs under the chair and wriggling from side to side. She looked like she really needed to use the bathroom but she was still tied up on a phone call so I left her to it and went back to reading the newspaper and drinking my coffee. A few minutes must have passed when I found myself glancing over again. Now she had one leg over the other and her free arm was wrapped around her legs with her body rocking slightly backwards and forwards on the seat. She was moving so much in fact that her hair was working loose but she didn’t seem bothered by that at all.

I read another article until my mug was empty then I decided to get up and take my mug to be rinsed mostly so I could get a letter view of my wife. The dog looked up at me as I got up from my seat and walked towards the kitchen but I just ignored him. I was far more interested in Donna! She was still crossed legged but now she was wriggling her bottom on the chair so much too. There was no denying she clearly needed to pee badly and part of me felt very sorry for her. I started wondering how long she’d had to go and how much she’d drank. When I reached the sink I got a bit more of a clue about the latter one as I saw two empty mugs in the sink waiting to be washed. Looking back over to the dining table I then noticed a couple of empty bottles of water behind Donna’s laptop that I hadn’t spotted before.

We’re pretty good at recycling so I rinsed my coffee mug and left it in the sink then dried my hands and quietly walked through to the dining room to get the empty bottles. As I got closer to my wife I could hear her tights rustling as her legs rubbed together, a noise that for some reason always turned me on. Starting to feel rather horny I didn’t want to disturb Donna so I returned to the sitting room noting as I passed my wife that she’d only managed to drink about half her mug of tea. Whoever was on the phone to her was clearly keeping her very busy.

I’d now been home over twenty minutes all of which time my wife had been fidgeting and squirming while working. I was no longer interested in anything in the paper as I felt my work trousers getting tighter and my core temperature rising. The tension of what was happening just the other side of the room to me was very much affecting me and I could think of nothing else. I didn’t want to stare but neither did I want to miss anything either as my own hand drifted easily to between my legs. I’d always found my wife sexy but somehow this was driving me especially crazy! I had to look again and just as I did my wife put down the phone, stood up suddenly from her seat and marched on the spot!

“Thank God! I thought she’d never stop talking! I really need to pee. Oh my God I REALLY need to pee!”

I don’t know the exact details of the technical stuff but I knew that my wife couldn’t simply put the phone down and run. I’d recalled her saying before that she had to sigh out on her laptop and update her call logs or something, but I could also see that these everyday tasks were now causing her huge stress as she sat back down on the edge of the dining chair with one hand under her skirt holding her crotch very tightly.

“I know I’m signing out early you stupid machine! Just let me sign out will you!”

I stood up instinctively wanting to help her.

“Everything ok honey?”

“Oh Des my hands are all sweaty and this thing keeps blocking me from logging out as I’ve not completed my contracted hours yet today. I’m so desperate for the loo too that I’m about to wet myself! I’ve been sitting here bursting for the last hour.”

“Can’t you just go?”

She was now standing again leaning over the table shaking and bouncing and dancing around frantically.

“If I don’t log out they’ll direct more calls to me which will mean I’ll pee myself. It’s now asking why I’m logging off early! Oh my God I’m gonna burst!”

I walked over to try and help though by now I was shaking too and so bloody horny my dick was shaking in my trousers where it was long, erect and thick. Hoping Donna was too distracted to notice I edged closer to her as she marched on the spot shaking her arms furiously. On the screen I could now see a drop down list that Donna was being forced to choose from. I skimmed the options and clicked on ‘Family emergency’ while my wife grabbed between her legs and moaned.

“They’ll think someone has died if you click that!”

I could feel my face turning red as my eyes met my wife’s.

“I’d say this was definitely an emergency Donna.”

Manically marching again with her hair wet with sweat and her neat hairdo falling out from all her bouncing around my poor wife almost screamed at me as she abandoned her laptop and raced to the loo shouting back to me.

“It is!”

I signed her out then immediately undid my trousers to release the pressure on my own body. While my wife was out the room I HAD to touch myself. I knew that what I’d just witnessed truly was the most unforgettable thing ever and the sexiest moment in my entire life. I couldn’t wait for my wife to return so I could kiss her and hold her and reassure her that I honestly didn’t mind coming home to her having to pee. Quite the contrary in fact as I now planned to finish work earlier more often in the hope of seeing her like that again.
