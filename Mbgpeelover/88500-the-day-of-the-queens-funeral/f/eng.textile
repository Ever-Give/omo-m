I started writing this months ago but then my circumstances changed and I couldn’t get on here. I recently finished it and hope to get back on here more.

Anyway I hope you all enjoy!

The day of the Queen’s funeral

I bet everyone in the U.K. knows what they were doing on Monday 19th September 2022. Me? I had much of it planned for days, though the actual day went nothing like I thought it would.

I’ll start at the beginning shall I? I’m not a huge royalist by any means. I celebrated the Jubilee and I know the basics of the family and remember a few of the weddings and stuff but this…well this is major history isn’t it? The Queen…well she’s just always been there. That’s what I tried saying to ma and pa, but they were still wary of my plans. I suppose ma has her reasons. Even I know death and funerals are major triggers for many and ma has been to too many funerals lately. There was the old neighbour Mrs Barks that ma knew well, then about a month ago her friend from her work had a tragic accident on holiday, and it’s not even been a year since her sister too. She maybe felt I was celebrating things that shouldn’t be celebrated, but it wasn’t like that. Anyway, I told her that her and pa could do whatever they wanted and I wouldn’t disturb them and that was that. I bought and made all the food and got up early to take it all down the garden to what’s now known as my ‘cave’.

My cave? Well it’s the old garage that pa and I gutted and set up as a place where I could be. Like a bedroom without a bed. A chill out pad sort of idea. It was all because I started talking about leaving home now I have a job. In all honestly with prices round here I couldn’t afford anything but in a small two bed bungalow I needed my own space. Ma did her usual grumping and moaning and nipping my head until pa, being the usual peacemaker, came up with the idea of the garage. So I sleep and eat in the house but I have space at the bottom of the garden to relax, watch what I want, hang out with friends and get my own space, but ma and pa see me every day and I basically still live at home. Hey, it works and I save a fortune so it’s all cool. I’ve got electricity, internet and heat so that’s as much as I need.

Ma and pa know my mates anyway, well the ones I’m closest to at least. Ahmed, Danny and Andy have all been in my cave loads so I figured they might all fancy watching the days events there with me. Andy was the only one to decline. His little lad was off nursery and the wife wanted him home to keep him amused, which was fair enough I guess. Then Ahmed text saying he had a friend who was keen to watch with some company so I told him to go ahead and let them come too. Why not I though.

It was starting early so by 8am there was four of us in the cave with the laptop on BBC1 live. Ahmed, Lyra (yes he brought a girl which I wasn’t expecting at all) and Danny sat on my corner coach and I sprawled on my giant beanbag amazed at what we were all watching. We watched the procession slowly moving when I suddenly realised I hadn’t even offered anyone anything to drink! I didn’t want to interrupt anything but there was so much going to be happening that I felt if I was going to make tea or coffee I’d better do it now.

@@I don’t have running water in my cave as it’s obviously still a garage in so many ways but I do have a coffee machine and a kettle and I’d brought out big bottles of water, milk and sugar. It was all very British of us all but we all had a mug of tea as we watched, silently sipping and listening. I glanced away from the screen to look at the bunch of people around me. Assuming Lyra was about ages with Ahmed and the others, even combining all our ages we still were nowhere near as old as the Queen! We were a right mixed up lot too. Danny with his short well groomed hair, clean crisp shirt and black tie and suit trousers, Ahmed with his torn black jeans, shiny brown knees poking through and black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, me with my darkest chinos on that are probably more navy than black because I hate black clothes and my black t-shirt that I think might actually be a pj top ma and pa got me last Christmas, then Lyra, with skin a little lighter than Ahmed’s which I could see only on her neck and arms and through her tights as she wore a calf length loose fitting Gypsy style black skirt and a white blouse with black trim. All very different but all captivated and respectful of the passing of our great Queen Elizabeth the second.

Just before the main event started I noticed the mugs were all empty so I put them on the coffee table and quickly asked if anyone wanted another cup. The guys all seemed fine but Lyra nodded as I put a plate of sandwiches and crisps near the laptop. The procession was incredible; poignant, religious, traditional, but somehow I couldn’t move away and neither could the rest of us. This really was history in the making and there was so little movement from any of us, other than Lyra sipping at her tea and the odd eye being wiped. It wasn’t until the procession finished an hour later that anyone actually ate any of the sandwiches or crisps and Lyra handed me her empty mug. She stood up from the sofa to hand me it as she looked around then quietly asked me if there was a bathroom she could use.

I felt weird talking with a funeral going on live on the laptop so I nodded and lead her out the side door and outside. It was a little drizzly and cooler outside but being out in the open I suddenly felt it was ok to speak. I made a comment about how incredible the event had been so far as we walked together down the back garden towards the main house. I put my hand on the back door handle and went to pull it down when I turned towards Lyra in shock. Weirdly, and very unusually, the door was locked. I didn’t want to say anything so instead I just casually turned and walked around the side of the bungalow with Lyra following me. My mind was working overtime but I still hadn’t made sense of it when we reached the front door only to find it locked too! Pa’s car was still there but I did realise on ringing the bell that Penny didn’t bark and only then did it occur to me that my parents might have taken the dog for a walk.

I turned to Lyra and apologised, giving her my thoughts on where my parents might be and saying I didn’t think they’d be long until they were back. She smiled and nodded and as we walked back towards the back garden she finally spoke.

“Don’t say anything to the others will you?”

“Of course not. Honestly I’m really really sorry about this. They ought to be back really soon. We can try again in ten minutes if you want?”

We had just reached the side door to the garage when she placed her hand on my shoulder catching me by surprise.

“It’s fine. Just pretend I went and everything is fine. I’ll just wait.”

I nodded as we walked quietly back inside seeing the others still glued to the proceedings. I was starting to need the bathroom myself so maybe we’d all head to the house soon before coming back for the next service later? That would work, provided I didn’t drink too much more before then.

It was now mid morning and we all sat back down watching as the first service began. So many world leaders, ex prime ministers and politicians, it was truly remarkable and amazing. Ahmed eventually caught my eye and smiled before interrupting the start of the service by saying he was just going out for a smoke. I nodded and he walked out alone. My eyes seemed to naturally drift to Lyra then as I noticed her watching Ahmed leave and shifting on the couch. I couldn’t help but wonder if she was aware that Ahmed was gay but I didn’t want to get involved. Danny, who’d been very subdued and quiet so far, leaned off the couch to reach the sandwiches and out of the corner of my eye I noticed Lyra shifting more as if she was thinking of leaving. It must have been at least half an hour since we’d been to the house and found it locked and I wondered if I should offer to check again or not?

I had such mixed emotions about it to be honest. I was embarrassed and felt really awkward about the fact the house was unexpectedly locked but I also felt a bit…I don’t really know..maybe excitement, that Lyra and I had this secret somehow that the others didn’t know. I knew she needed to pee but no-one else knew. It was like this secret knowledge bound us in some way and connected us and when Lyra caught me looking at her she sheepishly smiled and blushed a little. I turned away to look at Danny, the only other person in the room at that point, as he sat back down with a sandwich and continued watching my laptop.

About ten minutes or so later perhaps Ahmed came back in asking if he’d missed anything, casually grabbing some food. He hadn’t sat back down yet when he asked if I had anything else to drink other than tea. I got up and opened my mini fridge and offered him a cold can, automatically offering one to Danny and Lyra too. Ahmed then sat on the beanbag I’d been on meaning I found myself on the couch right next to Lyra, who had taken a can and was now sipping on it. Sitting beside her made me feel warm and even more connected to her and as I felt my own bladder signal to me a bit more that I could do with a bathroom trip it made me instantly wonder how Lyra felt. Had she forgotten about her need to go? Had it subsided like mine had earlier or increased since we’d returned? I couldn’t ask her, of course, especially as I’d only just met her a few hours ago, so I had to try not to think about it.

Then I felt her wriggle a bit. It was quite a sudden wriggle as she sat her can on a nearby little table and crossed her legs. Her top foot was in my eye line quite a bit now as the laptop sat on a coffee table in front of us and I couldn’t help noticing that her foot was sort of circulating which actually took my breath away a little as she had black tights on and a woman’s foot in black tights has always been a sight I have somehow really liked. Never thought had I seen a foot moving like hers. One minute it was turning like she was demonstrating every movement her ankle could make, then the toes were curling and then it was like her foot was tensing and tapping some invisible piece of furniture. Because of where her foot and leg were and where I was sitting, to everyone else, and hopefully to Lyra too, it looked like I was avidly watching what was happening in the live coverage on my laptop but my mind was most definitely elsewhere and I was hooked.

Then as suddenly as she had crossed her legs she uncrossed them and pushed her lower body back more in the sofa. I could feel every movement as our bodies touched every so slightly sitting right beside each other. I expected her to lean back onto the back of the sofa like I would to relax and let the furniture take my full weight but instead she seemed to tense her back and lean forwards with her arms on her knees. I could feel the tip of my manhood tingling more and more and some movement in my trousers. I definitely could do with emptying my bladder but I also felt enthralled by the fact I was now convinced Lyra needed to go even more than I did and that thought was compelling me to ignore my own need in favour of seeing what Lyra might do or say next. Since returning from the house she’d barely said anything and she really didn’t seem as comfortable as she was when she first came either.

None of us were talking but Danny somehow still felt the need to say loudly that we had to be silent as the coverage paused and 11:55 struck for the two minutes silence. It was the weirdest two minutes as we all sat staring at the computer or the floor deep in our own thoughts. There’s something about silence that seems to heighten every little movement isn’t there? Well it does for me and I could feel the tiniest of wriggles from beside me as Lyra sat tense upright with her head bowed looking at her own feet as I tried to think more about the Queen than the fact I could really go a piss and the beautiful lady beside me obviously needed to do the same.

The silence ended as abruptly as it had started and by the same person as Danny quite suddenly stood up, breathed out like he’d been holding his breath, smiled faintly and looked at me before announcing out of nowhere,

“Right. I was just waiting for that to happen before I excused myself. Don’t want to be disrespectful or anything but if it’s ok I’m gonna have to nip into your parents house for a minute. All that tea and cola…be back in a bit!”

I nodded as he walked out quickly and closed the side door. Ahmed must have been bemused as he chuckled to himself and commented after he’d left,

“Bet he’s glad that was just two minutes silence. I reckon he’s been dying to go for ages. No disrespect to her majesty but I’ve never seen a funeral drag out for hours like hers.”

@@Lyra looked at me right in the eye as I noticed her bite her lower lip anxiously. Ahmed clearly had no idea how desperate she was but her look said it all to me. With a combination of hopefulness that my parents were now back home and awkwardness both at being quite desperate myself and knowing Lyra was obviously bursting to go too I stood up and walked towards the side door. I was about to mention that I hoped my parents were back when another stern look from Lyra made me remember her earlier promise. Instead I opened the door and looked down the garden for Danny noticing that the back door to the house was still shut. I stepped out to get a slightly better view when I heard a noise and instinctively looked around the side of the garage to see the back of Danny standing against the side of the garage pissing. Not wanting to embarrass him, and assuming the house must still be locked, I looked immediately away and stood in the doorway. Glancing into the room I could see Lyra now off the couch and moving around and Ahmed lounging on the beanbag like he owned the place.

Not wanting to let either of them come out and catch Danny I remained in the doorway trying not to listen to Danny urinating but unable to block it out as I slid a hand into my pocket to fondle myself a bit as my own dick twitched more in need. If my parents didn’t return really shortly I’d have to search the garage for the spare house key because my own bladder was making me increasingly uncomfortable and a quick second glance inside told me Lyra was feeling similar as she paced the room looking flustered. I forced myself not to stare at her movements despite how entrancing they were as my thoughts were turning to things I shouldn’t be about a girl I barely knew.

My mind was definitely elsewhere when Danny suddenly appeared in front of me looking sheepish and red faced. Looking back at the house and then me he looked like he was about to say something when he then changed his mind and went back into the garage. I followed him and closed the door wondering now what to do. Had he got into the house I had planned to excuse myself to go next assuming Lyra would speak up or just tag along. But now that would be so awkward knowing Danny hadn’t got into the house and would draw attention to the fact he’d pissed at the side of the garage. Ahmed would make a huge thing of that and Danny would be mortified. The problem was my body wasn’t keen to wait much longer and I felt terrible about Lyra too.

As Danny sat back on the couch and Ahmed decided to join him there I turned away from them all to discreetly grab myself as I heard Danny talking to Lyra.

“You not wanting to sit down? Ahmed will make more room if you want?”

I hadn’t heard her speak much since we’d walked to the house and now her voice seemed so vulnerable against the male voices, so sweet and lovely and innocent.

“It’s fine. I’d rather stretch my legs for a bit. I’ve been sitting all morning so far.”

Having now got control of myself I turned around to see Lyra behind the sofa holding the top of it with one hand and leaning forward a little. I couldn’t see her other hand but suddenly I wondered if she too was doing what I had just had to do secretly. Was she that desperate now? After a minute or so she moved again pacing a bit back and forth which caught the attention of Danny yet again.

“You ok there?”

“Yeah. Just a bit of cramp. Sitting too long I think.”

Danny nodded and returned his attention to the laptop but I couldn’t help but wonder now. While I certainly needed a piss I hadn’t excused myself because I was still very aware my parents were out and the house was locked but Lyra wasn’t aware of that and it had now been at least 10 minutes or so since Danny excused himself so surely she thought the house was now open? I couldn’t understand it but I also couldn’t stop watching her as she paced around behind the couch stopping only to pull a leg behind her or move from foot to foot. What was she waiting for? But what if she asked to go again? How would I explain what Danny had done if she asked? I blushed just thinking about it slipping my hard back into my pocket and having to squeeze myself as the earlier tea tried to push its way back out my body.

Now the main service was over it was clear Ahmed was getting a bit restless too because he got up from the couch and began wandering around the garage looking at my books and computer games. Now the only one of us sitting was Danny, who looked by far the most comfortable and settled. I was busy watching Ahmed when I jumped as a hand touched my shoulder almost making me wet myself. It was Lyla who looked flushed and embarrassed as she whispered using a hand to cover her mouth from the others.

“Could I pop back to your house now if that’s ok?”

I quickly nodded feeling so awkward that I couldn’t think what to say. I opened the side door and headed out as the cooler air immediately hit me and I instinctively grabbed myself without thinking. I glanced at Lyra hoping she hadn’t noticed but she was looking towards the house looking very tense and anxious. Surely my parents would be back now? I wasn’t sure what I’d do if they weren’t as I approached the back door and pushed on the handle. It wouldn’t budge as I shot Lyra a rather flustered and shocked look as she looked me right in the eye.

“I’ll…I’ll try the front. So sorry. I really need in myself to be honest.”

“Oh my God!”

“They never do this. I really am sorry.”

“It’s not your fault. Really. It’s just..I just can’t wait much longer now. I need to use the bathroom so badly!”

“Oh God! Me too! Maybe they just forgot to unlock the back door. Let’s try the front.”

I marched quickly down the side of the bungalow gripping myself through my pocket anxiously. Just knowing I was closer to the toilet seemed to suddenly increase my urgency to go as I turned round to the front door and grabbed the handle with sweaty palms. I almost cried when it too wouldn’t open and I turned to look apologetically towards Lyra behind me.

Our eyes met and it was clear nothing I would say right now would make any difference. We were both clearly bursting and both of us knew it, but with the house locked we had so few options.

Just then a familiar dog bark made me turn quickly as I saw my ma and pa approaching the house with Penny. Oh thank God! Ma smiled at me as the dog bounded on the lead towards both Lyra and myself, excited to see us and inquisitive as to who this strange woman was with me. Pa was being pulled behind so he reached the door before ma but it was ma who spoke first.

“Hey, everything ok in the cave then? Sorry I’m Sophie, Alex’s mum. Excuse Penny, she’s a little excitable but she won’t hurt you.”

I wasn’t really in the mood for pleasantries as my bladder ached from having to piss for ages so I went right to the point.

“Pa why on earth did you lock the house when you knew I was in the cave and had friends round? What were you thinking?”

Pa shot me a look that I knew from many years of being put in my place. I might be an adult but in his mind I was his son and always would be.

“You’ve got a key haven’t you? We only went to walk the dog! It’s not like we went on holiday for goodness sake! You’re acting like you’re a little kid and we left you for days or something. Geez. Good to see you pa! Huh!”

I knew I was acting impulsively and immaturely but I just needed to piss and the pressure was driving me crazy. I actually forgot momentarily about Lyra as dad unlocked the door and ma walked through behind the dog. I was raised to be polite and have manners but the intensity of my urge to pee suddenly overtook me as I pushed in front of pa to get inside and to the only bathroom we had just along the hall. I didn’t dare push past my ma though as she hung up her coat excruciatingly slowly making it impossible to get past her. I assumed she’d head to the lounge as dad must have released the dog and she immediately headed there but instead she headed down the small hallway and…right into our only bathroom! Fuck! I wanted to scream as I grabbed myself and bounced like a little kid.

I wasn’t looking at pa but he was clearly looking at me as he tutted and sighed and spoke, presumably to Lyra,

“I guess that explains his haste to get in then! You’d think by his age he’d control himself a bit better though wouldn’t you!”

To be honest I was past caring what pa thought by this point. I needed all my effort to hold my bladder back and I knew then that if I had to wait for Lyra too I’d definitely not make it. I guess Penny suddenly remembered there was a stranger in her house as she suddenly reappeared in the hall sniffing at Lyra as pa called her back and ushered her back into the lounge. I couldn’t stop twisting and bouncing and squirming as I could feel myself sweating as I tried to remain in control of my body. Glancing at Lyra guilt overwhelmed me but as another spasm hit I banged the bathroom door begging ma to hurry up.

The minute or two wait felt like forever as I danced and held myself and squirmed, very aware that Lyra was still beside me silently waiting too. I really did want to be polite and let her go first, honestly I did, but the pressure was just way too much and as ma pushed the door open to leave I proactively knocked her over in my haste to get in.

That piss was one of the best pisses of my entire life! The power at which my flow hit the toilet was crazy and I was shaking with the sheer relief of it all. Oh my God it was absolute heavenly and so long too! I was over three quarters finished before I even remembered Lyra as I shook my exhausted and half erect member over the toilet pan and gave it it little stroke to get the final drops out. My eyes were watery with the bliss of actually making it on time after holding so long as I cleaned myself up and washed my hands. Glancing at myself in the mirror over the sink I was flushed and tired looking so I splashed my face before drying my hands and face on the towel and heading towards the door.

I guess I imagined Lyra would be right there as I opened the door or even pushing past me like I had done with my ma. Instead I couldn’t see her at all as I looked all around the hallway in bewilderment. I could hear ma and pa talking in the kitchen nearby but no sign of Lyra anywhere. I stood there confused and silent for a bit and trying to process and think. It was then I could hear a faint sound of springs. Like a rocking chair or a slightly squeaky floorboard or someone bouncing on a trampoline. I took a few steps down the hall and saw something that will forever be engrained in my mind for the rest of my life.

There, in my own bedroom, on my own bed, was Lyra looking more beautiful and radiant than ever, her face red and her eyes glinting, her legs stiff and rocking, her hands one over the other pushing tightly between her open legs as she sat there openly rocking on the side of my bed looking like she was…how do I even put this? Looking like she was pleasuring herself right on my bed! I stared at her open mouthed, my body sweating and my heart thudding. Instantly my manhood swelled and I slid a hand instinctively to try and hide it. This wasn’t exactly how you responded to someone you had only met that morning and who had come to watch a funeral at your house! It was so…inappropriate…yet so hot! The hottest sight I had ever seen in my whole life.

Embarrassment can really affect how someone reacts and it sure affected me right then. With a very dry mouth and nerves shattered I sheepishly looked down at my bedroom carpet to avoid looking anywhere at Lyra and sort of stuttered that the bathroom was now free and that I was sorry for going first. There was this silence then. Totally different from the earlier silence we’d had back in the den with the others. A more sensual, sexual, awkward, silence as I expected Lyra to move off the bed and go to the bathroom but she instead just smiled up at me as she rocked more as her cheeks flushed even redder.

That’s when I stared all over again but this time our eyes met and it was clear there was definitely a connection, a drawing, a…desire? I swallowed what little saliva there was in my mouth and tried to form words but it was Lyra who spoke first.

“Could you push the door behind you a minute?”

I turned, immediately shaking with fear that ma or pa might have seen what I just had but thankfully there was no-one there as I pushed the door quietly closed with shaky and very sweaty hands. Turning back my eyes betrayed me, or maybe it was just that my thoughts were now very suddenly overpowered by my surging hormones? In my defence Lyra was now quietly panting as her legs rocked rhythmically as her hands massaged and explored between her legs even with her clothing still on. Her legs had now widened and I found myself gawping at the gusset of her black tights which I could only just see between both her hands. Her head was now tilted ever so slightly back as I blinked in time to the subtle squeaks of the springs in my own mattress. What I was seeing was actually real. Never ever in my life had I ever seen such a sight.

I stood there mesmerised as through her panting and quiet grunts I could hear Lyra mutter something. I stepped a little closer, my penis so hard it ached against my chinos as I had this overwhelming desire to pull Lyra’s tights down and…well I don’t want to be crude but it was very hard to hold back I can tell you! I was dizzy with need now, hazy with horniness, as Lyra continued to rock harder and faster as her words became clearer to me even through her panting and gasping.

“Oh God. I think I’m gonna burst, oh. Oh. I’m dying for a pee so bad. So bursting. So desperate. Stay in. Please…oh…ah”

The room started to move a bit right then as I almost fell on top of poor Lyra as blood shot to my head (and somewhere else!) so quickly my heart skipped a beat. I steadied myself by gripping the end of my bed, my rock hard crotch then rubbing slightly on the wooden frame sending shivers up me as I tried to remain quiet and respectful. Lyra seemed oblivious as her rocking continued and her hands rubbed faster. Was she about to have an accident right on my bed? I honestly didn’t know as I was now close enough to touch her yet it still felt wrong. Oh I wanted to, more than anything else, but I hardly knew her and I was still trying to process what was happening even though looking back now it was very obvious. Part of me still thought she was just trying to hold her pee in. Maybe she was? It sort of looked like it but on a whole new, more intense level, but it also looked and sounded like sexual pleasure and it was most definitely feeling like that in my body too.

I moved my grip on the end of the bed a bit as the giddiness settled and as I lifted my hand it caught some of Lyra’s hair. I let it run through my fingers as her rocking changed pace and her body did this shake that seemed more like a shiver as I expected to suddenly hear a gushing sound but it never came. Slowly Lyra removed her hands from between her legs, her stiff legs relaxing as her head moved forwards and she looked at me grinning, red faced and sweating.

“You weren’t meant to see that.”

I sheepishly smiled back, embarrassed and awkwardly using my hands to cover my very obvious enjoyment as I tried to position myself at the side of the bed to avoid being caught guilty having thoroughly enjoyed a very private moment that I wasn’t meant to. Looking at the floor I apologised as Lyra stood up.

“I should apologise too. I don’t know what came over me. I hope you don’t mind that I sat on your bed to try and not embarrass myself. I was just so desperate to pee. Never been so bursting in my life to tell you the truth.”

Her use of the past tense suddenly intrigued me so much. She was bursting? But not now? I gazed at where she’d been sitting on my bed. Sure the bedding was wrinkled and a tiny bit damp looking with sweat but there was definitely no urine and the carpet was dry too. Confused I looked back at Lyra not knowing what to even say.

She must have read my thoughts as she shrugged and smiled timidly.

“It helped me hold. It’s starting to come back now though. I can feel it. Is it ok if I use your bathroom now?”

I nodded, unable to say anything coherent.

That’s when Lyra left the room and I stood staring at the creased under sheet on my bed shaking my head trying to think of anything other that what I had just witnessed. I waited alone there until Lyra stood in the hall a few minutes later just looking at me winking and smiling.

“I think we should get back don’t you? Don’t say anything to the others will you?”

I followed her down the short hallway calling through to my ma and pa to ket them know I was returning to my den. Lyra was much more talkative than before now as I closed the front door of the little bungalow and we walked slowly back around the side and down the back garden. Her eyes shone and sparked and her hair bounced as she walked. She was beautiful. Utterly stunning dressed in black with her figure hugging but professional white blouse, which I could tell from behind was still ever so slightly damp from where she had….

Well that’s something we talk about in the den between just us now. Ahmed and Danny left a few hours later but Lyra suggested she get an Uber back to hers which Ahmed was fine about.

The dear Queen’s funeral was long finished by the time she called that Uber as we drank tea together and talked until both our bladders ached and we laughed and squirmed for ages as we relaxed in each others company as it was obvious we were both so desperate but neither of us ever said, that secret between us and unsaid words just intensifying our physical attraction to each other more until we kissed deeply and helped each other hold until we giddily ran to the house hand in hand and raced to the toilet together for the second time that day.

Everyone remembers the day of her majesty Queen Elizabeth the second’s funeral. It’s just maybe my reasons for doing so are a little more personal that yours.

Thank you for letting me be the first to request a story from you, and sorry the request is so short. also how are you doing with real life if you don't mind me asking? if you do I'm sorry for invading your privacy.

Of course you can ask. My personal home circumstances changed significantly last August when one of my children became mentally ill and had a breakdown. They required 24/7 care and were too sick to even go to school. So now I home educate and have very restrictive time to myself but that’s what love is about and thats what parenthood is. I missed this site greatly and missed writing so much so as my child gets better I now intend to care for myself more by escaping on here as and when I can.

@@thank you for asking.

P.S. Your request isn’t brief just very different but I like a challenge and hope I do it justice.

Well, don't forget the sequel is coming up: "Our first proper date, watching the King's Coronation" 😁

I did consider that but judging how long it took me to get the one up about the Queen’s passing the king might even be passed himself by then haha.

@@seriously if I had time I definitely would.
