The girl at my cousin’s party

Author: Mbgpeelover

A deferred 21st. That what my cousin Isla called it. Her real 21st had been cancelled due to Covid and she consoled herself by promising it was ‘postponed not cancelled.’ We all smiled and agreed at the time not wanting to knock her coping strategy, but now a year later it’s the day she’s been building up to for 12 full months and I feel somehow obliged to attend.

I’m not antisocial really, just maybe a little socially awkward. Or maybe just shy. I’m ok if I know the people but this has become the event of the year to Isla and she’s been rather exuberant in handing out invites. I genuinely have no idea how many there will be in her house tonight between family, work colleagues and friends. I’ll show face and leave after a few hours. By then she’ll probably be tipsy enough to not even know who is there and who isn’t. That’s my hope anyway. It’s not like I’m expecting it to be the night my life changes. That’s the sort of thing that only happens to other people, not me.

By the time I arrive, on my own and on foot, there’s already plenty noise and laughter coming from the semidetached old Victorian house that my aunt bought when my uncle passed away. I knock and am let in by my exited and very young looking cousin wearing denim shorts with tights underneath and a tight top. I can see why she’s the life and soul of the party, though I worry that all the attention on her isn’t just because it’s her birthday.

I’m quickly handed a glass of something which looks vaguely drinkable and my younger cousin ushers me through towards the large rear garden where a BBQ has clearly been set up and there’s people sitting in plastic chairs and standing around talking pretty much everywhere. I scan for an empty seat and sit down at the edge of a group of people laughing, hoping I haven’t accidentally taken someone’s seat. Looking around I sip at the drink in my hand wondering if my dear aunt has any idea just how many people her daughter has invited. She probably has and as usual I’m just stressing about something unnecessarily. A woman sits beside me and as she talks I suddenly turn to her wondering if she’s talking to me or someone else. Her smile is cute and her long brown hair, all clipped up in some sort of bulldog type clip thing with little strands trailing onto her pretty face, is actually rather eye catching making me want to gently move the strands away so I can see her full face clearer.

“She chose a good day for it didn’t she?”

“Isla? I don’t think she had much say in when she was born but I’m sure she’s delighted it was early summer. She hated it when she was younger mind you. Her friends were always on holiday then but I think she’s more than made up for the lack of parties at 9 and 10 judging by the amount here today. Popular girl for sure.”

“Oh…you her brother or something?”

“Older cousin.”

I hold my hand out instinctively to introduce myself.

“Riley Smallwood.”

She shakes my hand, smiling, and I look at her sweet pink cheeks hoping my first words to her haven’t put her off me already. She’s probably got a boyfriend who is about to turn around and growl at me right away to warn me off. At least I can see there’s no ring on her fingers. That’s a definite good sign at least.

“Rosie Lynch. I went to school with Isla. Probably one of those annoying friends who went on holiday early summer and missed her birthday when she was 9 or 10. You reckon she’s forgiven me now since I’m here tonight?”

I blush.

“I expect so.”

I can’t help laughing a little as Rosie smiles cheekily right at me as if she knows she’s just scored some sort of imaginary social point against me. She’s cute so I’ll let her off.

Someone distracts her and before I know it she’s standing up again laughing and chatting with other people I don’t know and I look around quietly again at the mature garden and the rear of the house wondering how much inheritance my uncle actually left. I had no idea he actually had so much wealth!

The party carries on with an abundance of food and plenty music and drink, and as the evening progresses I notice the garden getting less busy and the numbers slowly thinning. I’d really like to bump into Rosie again but I don’t want to look like I’m too keen, even though I actually am. Those hazel eyes of hers and those cute strands of hair got me and I’d love to see if we connect more.

I’m standing in my cousin’s vast kitchen nibbling on party food and pouring myself a soft drink to balance whatever alcohol I’ve been sipping for the last hour or so when I see her again. It’s that clip in her hair I notice from behind first, but then my eyes drift down to her neck and her back and my mind races ahead of me. She’s wearing one of those female jump suit things with trousers and a top combined and the zip up her back immediately makes me think of two rather naughty things: how easy would it be to unzip that and see beneath it, and even naughtier still: how on earth can she possibly unzip herself to use the loo if she needs it? The black material seems snug against her back and I’m suddenly glad to be standing against a kitchen island to hide my growing excitement.

I wasn’t going to stay this long but suddenly this party has got much more interesting.

As I hear some more people leaving Isla comes into the kitchen announcing she’s going to start the karaoke up. I wouldn’t normally be that bothered by such a development but as I watch Rosie heading into the main room I decide to go on through too. I catch her looking over at me as I stand against a wall gazing at her. I know I shouldn’t but now that I can see the front of her jump suit I like her even more! It hangs loose on her shoulders as if gravity ceases to exist on her body and shows off her curves in every way possible, making me sweat a little just thinking of how she got it on and how she might get it off again. I still can’t shake the thought of how she might go to the toilet but I can’t even entertain that for fear of anyone seeing the reaction it has on me.

More drinks are distributed and glasses topped up. I accept some more wine and notice Rosie is drinking away between snatching glimpses of me and singing along to whatever is being played. There’s definitely a spark of something between us…at least I hope there is. Another thing I notice too, and I hope I’m not imagining it, is the way she’s sitting on the end of the couch. She’s sitting turned to the side, her back straight and one leg slightly over the other. It’s not really that relaxed looking and my mind is racing at just the very thought that all that wine, and whatever else she might have drunk in the last few hours, might be sitting in her bladder right now hinting at her rather a lot that she should go empty it’s contents soon. I’m probably imagining that though, as wonderful and sexy as it is. I need to calm myself before she notices my growing bulge in my jeans!

I could probably predict some of the first songs that get sung with Isla starting us off with Whitney Houston and “I want to dance with somebody”. Like the song she has no shortage of willing men keen to dance with her! I watch Rosie singing along and swaying on the couch, keeping those gorgeous legs of hers crossed the whole time. There’s a bit of a clamber for some more songs and after some Kylie Minogue and some Queen I notice that Rosie is definitely looking either tipsy of fidgety, or maybe both. She’s also looking at me a bit more, at least I hope she is. I edge a little closer as a few more people get up and dance.

When Rosie shifts around looking nervous I watch as she gets off the couch and I, trying not to look too obvious, follow her. She pauses in the big hallway and appears to look upstairs before changing her mind and heading to the kitchen. I head behind her, quickly finishing my drink so at least I have an excuse to be in the kitchen too. As her feet move from the thick hall carpet to the luxuriously tiled kitchen I tingle with excitement at the noise of her strapped black sandals on the floor. She heads straight for the fridge and I catch her eye as she notices me enter the otherwise empty room.

I’m glad when she speaks first, my own throat feeling like it’s suddenly a sandy desert in the blazing summer heat.

“Do you think they’ll mind me taking one of these?”

She’s holding a cold bottle of water which makes me almost laugh. I thought she was maybe helping herself to caviar or goats cheese or something else highly expensive, not a measly bottle of water.

“I reckon they won’t miss that.”

She closes the door of the fridge as the noise of those heeled strappy sandals on the tiles send shivers down my spine. She’s antsy and moving loads from foot to foot. I can’t tell if she’s nervous or tipsy or…something else that I daren’t even think about. I notice she’s struggling to get the bottle open as I put my hand out to offer to help. She hands me the bottle, our fingers touching for a second, and looks right into my eyes. There’s definitely a spark. It’s not just me!

“You needing a break from the alcohol then?”

“Mmm. I’d like to remember tonight and not wake up tomorrow in the loo.”

Just the mere thought of Rosie in the loo is making my head spin but I nod like a little puppy knowing she means having a handover but unable to think of anything other than her sitting on the loo peeing, which instantly makes me very hard! Realising I have suddenly went very rosy cheeked I blurt out my inner thoughts before I realise I’ve done it.

“Waking up hungover in that gorgeous jump suit you’re wearing would be a nightmare I imagine. I’ve actually been wondering, please excuse my ignorance, but how do you…how do you…get that on yourself what with…what with it zipping up the back?”

Thank goodness for the excuse of having had some alcohol but even so I’m still embarrassed by my own words in front of this beautiful girl. At least I never mentioned peeing!

Thankfully Rosy laughs as she dances around again right in front of me.

“I got my sister to zip it up for me. It’s so comfy though, but a right pain to get on and off especially when…”

It’s her turn to blush now as she steps closer to me holding my shoulder to steady herself as she lifts one leg up behind her. She puts her mouth closer to my ear as I feel my back sweating and my heart pounding…

“…I’ve had a lot to drink..”

I gulp. She hasn’t exactly said she needs to pee but I think that’s what she means. Fuck I want to kiss her so badly! Instead I pull her closer and hold her with one arm around her waist. Just touching her is so warm and wonderful and making me yearn for much more.

“I take it your sister isn’t here to help right now?”

She shakes her head, giggling, then pulls me by the hand next door to where everyone else is. I prefer being alone with her but her holding my hand is so bloody wonderful I’d go to anywhere right now that she took me as long as she kept hold of my hand!

Back in the lounge the singing and dancing has really taken off and Rosie gets up to dance to someone singing The Clash “Should I stay or should I go?”. It might all be in my mind but she’s mouthing the words to me and dancing very flirtatiously and very definitely like she really has to pee too. If I didn’t know better I would be mistaken for thinking the words for her are actually very pertinent and her eyes hint the same. 

Is she actually asking me, via the song and her dancing right in front of me, wether she should go to the toilet or stay with me? The repetitive chorus at the end as she mouths right in my eye line, “Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble, and if I stay it will be double, so you’ve got to let me know, should I stay or should I go?” is driving me fucking crazy with wanting her. She ends by coming right up to me bending forwards with begging eyes and a hand on her thigh as I bend slightly down, kiss her cheek lightly and whisper to her just one word…”Stay.”

She smiles at me and I can’t help but reach out and pull her towards me as I kiss her gently on the lips, nothing too intensive or deep, just a way of showing her that I want her and like her. She doesn’t object and turns to face the karaoke again allowing me to hold her from behind gently. I look around checking no-one appears to be objecting as the next singer takes the microphone and set up their song. I recognise the song right away and almost want to laugh. It’s couldn’t be more perfect right now and ABBA’s Waterloo will surely get everyone singing so loud they won’t even notice what’s going on with me behind the beautiful girl in my arms who is already squirming and dancing even before the song even starts properly.

The singer begins slowly, at first hitting more than one bum note, but by the first chorus Rosie is really getting into it as she turns in my arms to face me and we dance together with my arms now around her neck. She’s looking at me with twinkling eyes and I can tell she’s tipsy but still aware and by the second chorus our heads are closer together and I hear her singing the words to me with her own very sexy twist…

“Need the loo, wouldn’t escape if I wanted to, need the loo, knowing my fate is to be with you, na na na na need the loo, finally saying I need the loo.”

Fuck fuck fuck! Has she any fucking idea what she’s doing to me?

As the song finally goes quiet I know I can’t let her go, partly because I adore what she’s doing to me and secondly because the second she moves it will be bloody obvious that I’m rock hard and gagging for it! I need privacy urgently so I take Rosie by the hand and we head out into the hall before the next song starts. Away from the crowd she’s even more adorable as she pee dances more openly and even slips a hand between her legs. Even after a few drinks I won’t ever do anything without consent so I lean down towards her face and quietly pull her into a hug so I can ask her what I’ve been dying to ask all night long.

“Would you like a hand to unzip your jump suit so you can go to the bathroom Rosie?”

She’s still squirming badly even as I hug her.

“Yes please! I’ve been bursting for absolutely ages! I’m so desperate! Please!”

She looks up the staircase longingly, probably assuming that’s where the bathroom is. There is one up there, more than one in fact, but there’s one much closer right behind the kitchen too so I take her hand and lead her down the hall and through the kitchen then slide a door to a pantry that has a bathroom just beyond. It’s not one Isla will have told the guests about so we should have plenty privacy, but more importantly it should be better for me to help unzip Rosie without having to go into the loo with her. Of course I would love to watch her pee, to see the look on her face when she finally releases all the liquids she’s been steadily consuming all night, to hear the force of her urine hit the pan, but only if she consents. For tonight she’s already turned me on more than I can actually believe and just unzipping her jumpsuit will probably make me cum if I’m not careful!

Rosie follows behind me moaning under her breath. As I find the light for the pantry and open the door ahead to reveal a single toilet with small sink I hear Rosie whimper and groan.

“Hurry up Riley. I can’t hold this any longer!”

My dick is throbbing and the material of my jeans feel so taut against my crotch. I could easily delay Rosie that tiny bit more, cause her to perhaps wet herself and see her jump suit darken but then just the thought of her feeling embarrassed and humiliated and possibly rushing home terrifies me so I have her stand in the small bathroom facing the toilet while I bend forward to reach her zip on the back of her neck.

“Can’t you speed up? I’m weeing a bit already! This is torture you know.”

“I know. Sorry not used to these things. Promise you I’m doing it as quick as I can!”

My heart is throbbing so loud I’m sure Rosie must hear it, my fingers are sweating and my hard on is rubbing against my jeans so much it’s actually sore. I ache to cum right now and unzipping the jumpsuit to reveal that Rosie is in fact bra less is almost the end of me as I take a breath in, pull the zip right down quickly and step back. I don’t plan on giving her an audience but the speed at which she turns her body in front of me, pulls down her frilly black lace trimmed knickers and then sits down gasping revealing the most erect nipples on the most glorious breasts I have ever laid eyes on in my life is just too much.

I know I’m staring but she’s laughing and sighing and the relief on her entire face is so spectacular as torrents of liquid pour loudly into the toilet pan beneath her powerfully and strongly. She lifts her face to look me right in the eye as I stand with my own legs slightly apart to steady myself feeling my hard dick vibrating on its own accord in my jeans. Rosie’s eyes move to my crotch as I blush in embarrassment.

She’s still bloody peeing as she breaks the silence, apart from the noise of her urine, as she giggles like a little girl, looking down at her own nakedness then back to me.

“No need to be shy Riley. You’re seeing me so only fair I emmm…see…”

I feel like a nervous school boy but the rawness of the hard denim against my manhood is holding me back so I unclip my belt and jeans and pull them down to my knees along with my trunks. My erection jumps to life like a coiled spring as Rosie, unbelievably STILL peeing, uses her hands to beckon me closer and I step closer feeling suddenly so nervous and alive that every hair on my body is sticking up. I’m not sure if she’s going to suck me or touch me with her hands or what but right now I don’t fucking care as I am so close to erupting she could blow on me and I would explode!

She’s still sitting on the toilet as I hear spurts and dribbles still coming from between her legs as her hand reaches between my legs and tenderly strokes my testicles making me yelp with pleasure. She then lifts my erection up in her hands and precedes to run her wet warm tongue the length of me from my testicles to my head as my entire body shakes so much I have to lean on the wall to steady myself. I can’t stop staring at her breasts and listening still to drops still dripping from her into the bowl beneath her as she fondles and strokes me with her tender hands as I know I am just seconds away now from ejaculating. Rosie senses it too as her thumb runs over the shaking head of my hard on as I gasp as I reach the pinnacle of my sexual peak and sticky white fluid explodes out of me towards Rosie as we both watch giggling as it lands perfectly on her frilly black knickers draped by her knees.

“Mmmm. I wasn’t planning to wear them now anyway. They were already wet with my pee so what does it matter.”

I step back to let Rosie up off the toilet, offering her my hands to steady her as she steps out of her jumpsuit and knickers and stands right in front of me totally naked. She looks around giggling before reaching down and tossing her knickers towards a tiny open wastepaper basket designed for nothing more than used toilet rolls then she steps her feet back into her jumpsuit and starts pulling it up her legs teasingly.

“You are beautiful. Absolutely stunning.”

“And knickerless. Don’t forget the knickerless now will you?” She laughs.

I help her pull her arms back into the suit then turn her around slowly while I attempt to zip up the material, running my fingers up her spine as I do so. Once the zip is done she turns to face me as I lean down to kiss her, this time much more passionately, as my dick still hangs out my jeans getting hard all over again. When we stop for air I feel suddenly quite overwhelmed as I attempt to make myself decent and wash my hands.

“Can I get your number Rosie?”

“Only if I get yours?”

We walk out of the toilet, through the pantry, and into the kitchen hearing singing next door and smiling to each other. The atmosphere has mellowed while we’ve been gone and I can hear my cousin singing with a male as I hold Rosie’s hand and ask her to dance with me. She nods as we sing along to The time of my life by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warns.

“I’ve had the time of my life, no I’ve never felt this way before, and I swear it’s the truth. And I owe it all to you..”

It’s late, it’s corny, but it’s also the truth. A 21st burthday that was really a 22nd. Rosie. The girl at my cousins party who I will never ever forget, in the black jumpsuit with the bulldog clip in her hair with two little stands on her face. The girl who was desperate for the toilet at a party and needed help to unzip her clothes. The girl who went home knickerless and who I have been dating ever since.

And definitely an omo dream I'd love to experience.

If you enjoy wetting, think of the benefits, if there’s no young man (or older 😉 ) available to assist, although I’m sure there would be plenty of willing assistants, you can just wet yourself, and to deflect just say couldn’t get it off in time.... or it could be thrill to wet with the man in close proximity just not quick enough to assist...... a win win lol

But goodness... what a thought to experience the original story line, as a male.. awesome,

}}

I’m hugely into the desperation but if there was no-one to help then there really is only so long one can wait…

I would love to see this story in pictures too. Sadly I am much more of a BBW than Rosie which isn’t to everyone’s liking so art might be better lol.

Erotic as it is which we all loved, the work involved to give the story depth and incorporate song lyrics has to be applauded,

Jodies confidence showing and why not, as she craftily sings Waterloo and changes the lyrics while dancing up close with the man... no wonder he had a Rager! Lol,

Somehow knowing the author is female adds something magical to Rosie’s character too, awesome !

And to end as it did and not ‘she peed in the garden’ takes us to another level,

Mbgpeelover you need to get creative and give us another glimpse into Rosie’s adventures... Please !😀

I have been really struggling to top this so maybe you are right and we need to hear more from Riley Smallwood and Rosie. After all he ends by saying they are now dating so it leads on nicely to us perhaps spying in on their first date or something…mmm…let me think…

*022*2022-03-14 00:49

Part two is coming soon! Just to let everyone know…the next date of Rosie and Riley…

*023*2022-03-14 09:35

What happens next:

The next morning I wake, my head instantly reminding me of how much I drank the night before and my hard on reminding me of my erotic dreams about Rosie. I let her go home herself. It was the right thing to do but even as we physically parted she lived on in my body and mind all night long. Now I need coffee, I need to cum and I need to piss. I decide to start with the coffee and head straight to my kitchen. Filling the kettle and putting instant coffee in a mug seems to make my dick calm quickly and I have to run like Usain Bolt to the bathroom only just making it in time. Was this how bloody amazing it felt for Rosie when she peed last night at my cousin’s house? There really isn’t any other feeling like it I think as I wash my hands and head back to make my coffee at last.

I should text her or is that too keen? It was just one night. What if she can’t even remember it like I can? She gave me her number though…that has to mean something right?

I spend the rest of the morning and afternoon trying to shake my hangover away and replaying the events of the night before over and over. Finally, just as I’m making dinner, Isla texts me to say thanks for coming and thanks for her gift. She must have finally opened everything after getting too carried away with the karaoke at the end. Well the karaoke and the man who had his arms around her neck by that time. I can’t help wondering if he stayed the night or not. Not my business really but I still feel more than a little protective of her. I text her back saying it was a great night and worth the years delay with a smiley emoji. I expect she’s texted a huge amount of those who came last night, which would be just like her, but she texts back again with something that makes me smile but get excited too.

“Apparently Rosie had a gr8 nite too! 😉”

That decides it for me right away and I swallow my embarrassment and decide to text Rosie. I keep it as cool and causal as I can to begin with but then lose myself far too quickly.

“Hi, was lovely to meet you last night at the party. Hope you had a good night? I sure did. Fancy a coffee sometime? Or even dinner? Riley x”

I feel like a teenager all over again! She keeps me hanging for a while, the entire time it takes me to finish cooking tea and eat it AND watch something on TV. I am half way through the washing up when finally I get a text back. Just three words (excluding her name) but I still blush and smile like I have just read that my lottery numbers have won! “Yes to both, Rosie x” I presume she works so set up an evening meal date but keep it to a family restaurant near my home just so she feels safe and hopefully relaxed. If things don’t go any further then we can both go back home without too much issue.

Monday I keep myself so busy at work to pass the time but as soon as mid afternoon starts creeping up I can feel my nerves kicking in. By the time I get to the restaurant and sit at the table I booked my hands are sweating and my mind racing. What if she changes her mind? What might she be wearing this time? Will I still fancy her when she’s not dancing around in front of me needing to pee?

That all disappears instantly when she walks in and our eyes meet. Tonight she’s in a stunning fitted flowery dress that shows off her body beautifully with bare legs and the same black high heeled strap around her ankles sandals she wore to the party. She has this cute shawl around her shoulders too meaning I can’t quite see from where she’s standing if her dress hangs off her shoulders or not but either way she’s hell of an attractive lady and although her hair tonight isn’t in that sexy clip she has it tied back again and still has those wonderful little strands by the side of her face that I adore so much. The waiter shows her to the table and I quickly pull her chair out for her like a true gentleman. I give her a quick peck on the cheek then sit down again smiling. She’s here, she’s beautiful and she’s already looking at the drinks menu!

She shyly asks if I mind if she sticks to nonalcoholic drinks as it’s a work night and her cute blushing is so adorable I don’t mind at all. I order two large lemonades and ask about her day. It seems a safe starting point but by the time we have ordered and began eating our starters we have already moved onto other things easily. We agree on a sharing starter and there’s more than a few flirtatious looks and comments between us as we tuck into the salad and chicken wings and potato skins. We talk so much that by the time we order the main course the waiter offers us both more drinks and our empty glasses are taken and replaced by fresh full ones with more lemonade again. 

The food is lovely but the company even better and by the time we’ve finished eating our main course I know already that I want to spend even more time with Rosie. The question is where is best to do this? It’s early days still and I don’t want to rush her but we can’t stay here all night and when I put my cutlery down and finish my glass of lemonade I smile at Rosie as she finishes her second large glass too and moves in her seat. Neither of us have moved away once so far and I could do with a bathroom break and I now suspect she could too. Just that little change of position she does in her seat makes me blush thinking back to Isla’s party on Saturday and I wonder if Rosie might consider not using the bathrooms here and waiting just a little bit longer?

“I don’t know about you Riley but I’m so full now.”

She rubs her tummy wriggling a little and I can’t help thinking does she mean her stomach or her bladder is full, or both?

“Definitely. Me too. Though I’d still like to enjoy your company a bit longer…if you’d like that too?”

She looks over in the distance a bit before giving me eye contact and smiling. Is she looking for the ladies perhaps? I don’t blame her as I could really do with a good piss myself but I just don’t want to leave Rosie, not even for a minute!

“That sounds good. Really good in fact. Actually a friend of mine is performing live tonight at the Horse and Cart on Beecroft Road. He’s really good though not sure if it’s your sort of thing or not?”

“My sort of thing?”, I enquire raising my eyebrows curiously.

“He plays the piano and sings. Sort of covers and ballads and that sort of stuff. Sort of sing along stuff more than dancing if you know what I mean?”

“Sounds lovely. Since I’ve only been on the still stuff we could maybe go in my car if you’d like? I only stay just around the corner from here. Save waiting on a taxi?”

Rosie does that glancing off to the distance thing again and I wonder what she’s maybe thinking about but then she smiles and twirls one of those dangling strands of her hair and blushes and nods at me. I link my arm in hers, leave cash on the table to cover the bill and a tip, and walk her out the restaurant towards my house. As soon as the cooler weather hits me I wish I had gone to the bathroom before leaving but with my house close by I clench my muscles and decide to not say anything. Rosie seems quieter too so I check she’s still ok as I see my car outside my house.

“Everything alright? If you’d rather call it a night I don’t mind taking you home if you’d prefer?”

“No. No. It’s not that I don’t want to go to the pub it’s just…that was rather a lot of lemonade I drank. Those were pretty big glasses and…”

I’m sweating now, sure of what she’s about to say and immediately feeling I should offer to let her use my facilities, especially as I really need to use them too. It’s not that I don’t want her to pee, absolutely not, and the thought of it reminds me so much of the party, but inviting her into my house on the first proper date feels a bit…full on? Like I’m almost asking her to stay the night? I don’t want her feeling I’m pushing her even though I would happily go further if she agreed.

“Would you prefer to come into mine? For a coffee before we go out? I’ve just realised I’ve left the car keys in the key box in my hall anyway. And…”

“I’d love that Riley. Thanks”

She moves from foot to foot as I put the house key in the lock and the noise of those sandals of hers on my concrete stairs outside sends shivers right through me. I can feel myself getting harder which isn’t great in my smart trousers because it’s very noticeable but it does at least help stave off that feeling of dying for a piss that I’ve been struggling with for the last twenty minutes or so.

I step in, taking Rosie’s hand and helping her over the upvc door base that always trips me up when I’ve been drinking. My house isn’t big in any way and there’s just the one bathroom upstairs with the living room with integrated kitchen area downstairs. Despite really needing to pee I feel I need to be hospitable and at least start making coffee before running off so I show Rosie to an armchair and fill the kettle and switch it on all the time watching her from behind. She’s sitting upright on the armchair leaning forward with her legs crossed at the ankle. She looks awkward and tense so I offer to put some music on.

“How about some music? Radio 1 ok?”

Rosie nods as I switch on the radio then go over towards her to sit on the arm of the armchair and put my arm around her as I can’t help singing along to what’s filling the room. Thankfully Rosie is just as taken with the song and it’s as obvious to me that she’s just as much a fan of Disney as I am as we look at each other singing happily to the words of Surface Pressure from Encanto and I can’t help but notice her hand on her upper thigh as she fidgets in the armchair beside me wriggling and bouncing to the chorus, ‘pressure like a drip drip drip that’ll never stop whoa, pressure that’ll tip, tip, tip ‘til it’s ready to blow whoa-oh-oh….who am I if I don’t have what it takes? No cracks, no breaks…”

We’re so caught up in the moment I forget all about the coffee and tea and the fact we’re meant to be going out in the car as I smile and gaze so much at Rosie and comment on her beautiful singing. I’m convinced, once again, that the words of the song have a double meaning for her and that she’s feeling a huge amount of pressure from her bladder but I don’t want to embarrass her in any way by pushing the matter but if she asks to use my toilet, which as soon as my own boner dies down I’ll be using myself, then of course I’ll let her go. But until she mentions it there’s no harm in enjoying things is there?

I kiss her as the next song plays after a very brief intro from the DJ. Rosie’s lips are sweet and soft and special and very enticing and I have to lean on my elbow to stop myself falling on top of her on the armchair. As we finally pull up for a breather I suddenly remember the kettle and ask Rosie if she’d like tea or coffee. I notice her look around the room first, probably searching for any sign of a downstairs loo, which sadly I don’t have, but she agrees to a tea and I go to make it behind her as the song currently playing ends and I’m walking towards Rosie with two mugs when my eyes bulge seeing Rosie remove her shawl to reveal that her dress is actually strapless and very fitted and low across her chest.

I sit the drinks down on a table, sit back on my two seater couch and tap beside me for Rosie to join me as the next song begins and I hold her hand looking right at her mouthing the words as if I am singing right to her. I couldn’t put it any better than Rudimental’s ‘Waiting all night’ as Rosie bounces her legs beside me and squirms very obviously as I sing to her,

“I’ve been waiting all night for you to tell me what you want,

Tell me, tell me that you need me,

I’ve been waiting all night for you to

Oh oh tell me what you want yeah…”

The song lyrics seems to repeat over and over as her movements intensify as her eyes glaze and her cheeks redden. There’s such a sexual tension between us that I know we both feel added and enhanced incredibly by the fact I know she’s really really bursting to wee and holding it in, because, like me I hope, she doesn’t want to break the bond that’s building quickly between us. One thing I do know is that if I was to tell her what I wanted and needed right now it would be rated 18 and over and not likely to be played on radio 1 any time soon either! My own heart is now beating furiously, my dick throbbing in my trousers and my mouth dry from singing and nerves as the song finally finishes and I notice Rosie’s hand has crept from her thigh more towards her crotch as her eyes water a little and she tries to say something that I don’t quite hear over the radio. I use the remote to turn the music down as I look at Rosie expectantly and ask her to repeat what she said.

“Do you really want to know what I want Riley?”

She’s a little giggly and shy again, her cheeks flushed and her forehead slightly sweaty.

“May I guess?”

She smiles and squirms beside me and that hand that was on her crotch seems to press a little firmer on her dress. I could easily make her wait longer messing with her suggesting answers such as the tea I have just made her, or to kiss again or go even further, but that feels a little cruel and she’s already driven me crazy with desire with all her squirming and fidgeting so I lean towards her and whisper seductively in her ear as clear as I can over the radio still playing (albeit a little quieter than earlier):

“Are you bursting for the toilet sweetheart?”

She nods, giggly shyly.

“Very much so.”

I take her by the hand and we race upstairs, my mind a whirl and my body yearning for so much more. I push open my bathroom door and point, smiling, blushing and looking right at Rosie.

“Emmm. Riley….could you help me? This dress is hard to lift up without it ripping. It would be better if you could unzip me…if that’s ok?”

She’s marching on the spot right in front of me, her moans sending me to a place of no return. Unzip her? Fucking hell she may as well ask me to fuck her…it’s like the party all over again, except this time there’s definitely no-one who might walk in on us, no-one in the house apart from us.

“Please…I’m dying to wee here!”

With my hands shaking I do as she asks knowing I really should shut the door and give her privacy but frozen to the spot in utter amazement and shock as she lets her dress fall right off her body leaving it lying at my feet and runs to the loo with a hand wedged over her knickers as I stare at her naked breasts and nipples as she sits on the toilet right in front of me for the second time in a week and I watch as this absolute babe pulls down her knickers right in front of me and lets loose a torrent of urine flow that makes my mouth open in shock.

“Oh God this feels so much better! I’ve been holding this in since the restaurant and..God it’s like…it’s like…oh the release…oh…”

She seems to shiver, gasp, moan…

“You ok?”

Her pee is loud and furious and long and…

“It’s like a fucking orgasm! That’s what this is like Riley…so fucking incredible to be finally letting this out after holding so long…”

I can’t take my eyes off her, my own body shaking in need too…not a need to piss, although I know the second I’ve cum that will return stronger than ever, but a need right now to have Rosie, to make love to her, to show her another orgasm every bit as good as what she’s feeling right now, in fact hopefully better.

I can’t contain myself any longer. I can’t resist.

I stride up to Rosie as she sits totally naked on my toilet, other than those amazing heeled black strapped sandals, still peeing ferociously and loudly. I bend down onto my knees and kiss her deeply, my hands exploring her breasts and nipples, her neck, her back, her hair as she continues to pee throughout. I kiss her neck and she giggles telling me I’ve found a place she clearly likes. I whisper in her ear as little dribbles of urine still drip from her vagina into my toilet…

“Was it really like an orgasm? You sure about that? Want to test that theory?”

She’s finally stopped peeing as I take her hand, stand up and help her do the same. Her nipples are so erect, her breasts round and gorgeous right in front of my face, her hair not anything like as perfect as it was at the start of the night but sexy and enticing more than ever. She reaches automatically for some loo roll as I pull her hand away gently.

“Don’t worry about that babe. A few stray dribbles won’t bother me…”

She giggles pulling my belt undone and tugging my trousers and trunks down feeling down my legs as she does so. I know her actions say so much but just to be sure I cup her chin in my hands and look at her face carefully.

“You ok to carry on?”

“More than ever Riley. More than ever.”

She did orgasm, as did I of course. Immediately after, as I predicted, I had to rush out and piss. I hated leaning Rosie but she’d have been drowned in a huge puddle of urine if I hadn’t! Then as I finish and flush the toilet I almost jump out my skin at the voice behind me as Rosie’s voice sent shivers up my spine yet again.

“Did you hold all that in for me baby? God you must have seriously had to go!”

As I wash my hands and dry them I turn and look at her standing in my bathroom doorway completely naked looking right at me.

“I was needing to go bad in the restaurant but once we got back here I was so turned on I couldn’t go. So I suppose I did hold that in for you, yes.”

“Where you turned on that I had to go?”

“So much sweetheart. So much.”

“I like that you know. Maybe I’ll have to go bad again on our next date too.”

“Now that would be wonderful…both you needing to go and another date with you. Rosie…you do know you are beautiful don’t you?”

“Is that with or without a full bladder?”

She’s winking and giggling and I fling my arms around her for a hug before we finally get that mug of tea and I drive her home.

Our dates have just got better and better ever since. I’ve actually never been so glad to have met someone at a party ever in my life. Ah Rosie…she’s more than I ever dreamed possible in so many ways.
