The lore behind this story is so wild. I love it. They said it couldn't be done, and you took that as a challenge.

Your utopia probably keeps a good portion of its comrades on street cleaning duty to deal with odors. One might imagine that the outsize street cleaning needs have kept employment high since the nineties and helped further insulate the island from the various pathologies of Russian de-industrialization.

I know you're all probably tired of me bumping this story up without updating it, but I promise, I'll try and get another chapter out at some point, and maybe some more one-offs.
