The first one is about Magnifo peeing himself during his magic performance

Magnifo was nervous, his legendary magic show was about to begin. Everyone was filled with anticipation - he was about to display the most daring tricks known to Mixels. As he opened the curtain, the audience burst into loud applause.

But then, something unexpected happened. Without warning, Magnifo felt a sharp pressure in his lower abdomen. He gasped in horror and realisation flooded through him - he was about to pee his pants.

He tried to contain himself, but it was too late. A warm stream of urine trickled down his leg, and suddenly the applause turned to gasps of shock and surprise. Magnifo blushed with embarrassment, as the audience slowly began to laugh. He quickly ran off-stage, never to be seen performing magic again.

It was no surprise that Magnifo's magic show was never the same again - he never recovered from the embarrassment of peeing his pants in front of the audience. But it would prove to be a valuable lesson - drinks plenty of water before any performance.
