Hey, given its been like 3 years since I've posted anything here I wouldn't expect more.

To be completely honest and its not due to any specific person on here, but I kind of fell out of love with this community. As such, it's hard to find the enthusiasm to write more. I do appreciate though that you liked this story and came back even after all this time. But I doubt I will write more.

Thanks again though.
