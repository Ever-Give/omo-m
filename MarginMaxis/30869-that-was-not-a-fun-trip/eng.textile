My first first person so here we go...

"yo my name Is Lexi and I'm here to say, my friends are taking me on a plane"

"I am Thomas and my beats are whack,get outa my face or I smak ya bak" we sang as we waited on the plane.

" Heh nice guys " said Clara

"we are now ready for takeoff so stay seated as we increase altitude"

One hour later...

"I'll have a cracka cola,Thomas what about you?"

"Smite soda please"

"I'm ok I don't need anything"

So this ride is long,I'm Lexi...it's my first time on a plane and I'm really nervous but my friend tom tom and Clara are with me on this flight so I'd say I'll be ok...but at this moment I felt a heavy feel in my bladder so I said " I'm going to the bathroom",the door was locked so I went back and sat down.

"So Lexi did you hear about Paul of duty crack blocks, I hear it's amazing,"

" yea.....is that person done yet"

" don't think so why"

" I really have to go"

The door opens and then someone else swoops in real fast.

" dang it"

One more hour later

"*fidget fidget*"

" are you ok Lexi "

" I'll be ok Clara it's just gotten EEP..."

"What what what's happening "

" it just leaked I can't wait much longer"

" I'm sure you'll be ok "

" attention folks, there will be some turbulence up ahead it's nothing to worry about."

" ...uhhhhhh, good luck..."

Fifteen minutes pass

" *squirm fidget squirm bump leak* "

" Lexi just go stand by the door "

" o...ok"

Ten minutes later

" I...I'm...losing...it........"

Slowly a stream a pee goes down her legs onto the floor of the plane, everyone looks, some laugh, some take a picture, but her friends couldn't do anything but look,they all got off the plane and went strait for their hotel room...everyone they passed stared. When they got to their room Lexi changed, balled up, and started crying,but her friends were there to comfort her...it was then she knew Thomas and Clara where her truest friends...
