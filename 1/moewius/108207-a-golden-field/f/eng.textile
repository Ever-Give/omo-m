A Golden Field

It´s a translation of a story that I wrote once. English is not my first language, so I´m sorry for any possible mistakes in advance, I tried my best 🙂

###

It was time to leave. She glanced at the clock—it was time. She wanted to quickly use the bathroom, but her apartment had a combined bathroom, and her dad was in the shower. That meant it would take a while.

He had barely woken up on time today, jumping out of bed in a rush. He gulped down a backup beer to shake off the hangover from yesterday’s drinking, showered, brushed his teeth, and hurried out to meet her.

She lived in a new district on a hill, almost on the outskirts of the city, where high-rises, infrastructure, and roads paving over nature hadn't reached yet. He traveled for about thirty minutes across the city by minibus but made it on time. He even had time to smoke and mask the smell with gum while waiting by her entrance.

Finally, she came out—in a short beige dress with a floral pattern that barely reached mid-thigh. They hugged and kissed. It was hot.

Next to her neighborhood, there was an untamed field and an uncut forest where they had agreed to go for a walk. It was still in the city, but it felt almost like being in nature—far from cars, roads, and civilization. They set off on foot.

She liked everything except for the tea sloshing inside her. She regretted not going to the bathroom. The only comfort was that they were heading to a completely deserted place. Still, when it came to it, she'd feel embarrassed. Even if he didn’t see anything, he would know she had to give in to such a need.

They crossed the highway separating the district from the undeveloped field. A path led into a dense forest, beyond which the field stretched out. This area used to be botanical gardens, abandoned for about twenty years, now overgrown with wild vegetation.

They chatted about everyday things—school, university, and weekend plans. As they walked along the path, it became harder for her to resist pulling him by the hand, hugging him tightly (but not too tightly, so as not to press her filling bladder against him), kissing his cheek, mumbling, “Sorry, I’ll be right back,” and dashing into the tall grass to squat unseen. But she couldn’t.

He thought about the same thing after his morning beer, but his dreams were simpler—reaching the forest, stepping away for a moment, and standing by the nearest tree.

Neither of them acted on their thoughts, and they kept walking. The sun was already blazing, though it was far from noon. He was telling her a story when she suddenly stopped in her tracks. He turned around.

“What’s wrong?”

She shook her head, tightly crossed her legs at the knees, and bent over as if tying her shoelaces. It was a huge mistake because as she bent down, the belt on her dress, which had slipped from her waist, dug mercilessly into her bladder. She flinched and almost gasped. Besides, her shoes didn’t even have laces.

“Are you okay?”

She straightened up, dusted off her dress, and nodded. She held on. For a second, she felt relieved, but then thought—what’s the point? They were far from home already, almost in the woods, with no escape.

They kept walking. She felt sweat running down the inside of her thighs and desperately wanted to believe it was just sweat. But she couldn’t exactly reach under her skirt right there with him. She tried to take tiny steps, avoiding letting her thighs rub together with every step. It was probably just sweat. Her dress was already sticking to her back (she hoped not to her chest), and her forehead was damp with perspiration.

“It’s hot today,” he remarked.

“It’s fine,” she replied. “Once we get to the trees, it’ll be cooler.”

And indeed, when they reached the grove, they were met with coolness. The blazing July sun was left far above, barely piercing through the tree canopy. Shadows and a refreshing dimness enveloped them, and both let out a sigh—for the same reason. It felt slightly better.

He found it easier; he was aroused. From her scent, her fleeting and seemingly accidental touches, her evident restlessness. At first, he wasn’t sure if it was desire, but when she bent over again, exhaled loudly, and loosened her already slipping belt, shifting nervously from foot to foot, everything became clear to him. She needed to pee. And just the thought made him harder.

They walked along a well-trodden path through the forest, and he wondered how much longer she could hold on. He tried to keep the conversation going, masking his inner tension. This was their first time in such a situation. Occasionally, he thought it might be interesting to observe her during an intense moment of desire, but he had never imagined it would happen today, here and now.

She mentally calculated the distance. Soon, they would exit the forest, and she knew she couldn’t delay any longer. Beyond lay a field of tall grass, but she’d be too exposed there. Now was the time. Inhale, exhale. She bit her lip and tugged at his hand.

“What?” he turned to her.

There was a plea in her eyes.

“Excuse me… Can I step away for a moment?”

He feigned indifference.

“Of course.”

She turned away, her short dress flipping up to reveal her thighs and the curve of her lower back before she disappeared into the bushes. He listened carefully. There were faint noises in the distance.

She burned with embarrassment. She hadn’t explained why, but it was obvious—what else would a girl be doing stepping into the bushes in the middle of the forest?

He waited for her on the path. She hadn’t asked him to turn away, but the thick foliage concealed her entirely. That was fine. Even if he couldn’t see her, he knew that, just a few meters away, she was easing her desperate need to pee.

She found a hidden spot behind a large tree, leaned against the trunk, and instinctively hiked up her dress as she squatted down. But just as she began to relieve herself, there was a rustle nearby.

“Ah!” she gasped, freezing mid-squat, her dress lifted, legs apart, and gray panties pulled down to her knees. Her muscles clenched instinctively, stopping the small stream that had just begun to dampen the dry branches beneath her. Someone was coming.

He still waited on the path when a group of young men on bicycles approached. This area was ideal for cycling, and they seemed to have chosen it for a break.

“Alright, guys, let’s stop here. I need to take a leak,” one said.

The cyclists left their bikes by the path and confidently strode into the underbrush.

Hearing the crunch of twigs underfoot, she clenched her muscles tighter, stood up, pulled up her panties, and smoothed down her dress. From her hiding spot, she watched as the cyclists spread out, choosing trees to stand by, chatting loudly about how much ground they had covered and how much more lay ahead.

A treacherous warm droplet could already be felt in her panties, but her muscles seemed to have locked up completely. She felt as if a massive gate had appeared between her legs out of nowhere, refusing to let a single drop escape.

No one came her way, and she realized the alarm had been false. She could have continued, but now the place of privacy had been irreparably violated. Besides, she’d been gone too long already, and he was waiting…

“What if he thinks I went… for something else?” The very thought made her stomach churn. Taking a deep breath, she straightened herself and, with as much dignity as she could muster, walked back toward the path.

As she returned, he decided to slip away for his turn. By now, the cyclists had finished and were heading back to their bikes. Alone, he found a spot by a tree and unzipped. He had a full erection, imagining her peeing nearby, her desperation.

He was wondering if she was already filled to the brim and couldn’t hold it any longer, or did she just think rationally and decide to go before it was too late? Did she squat fully or pee while half-crouched? Did her panties get wet? What color are they? Did any splashes get on her shoes? He tortured himself with these thoughts until he reached his own release.

The cyclists were already long gone, and they found themselves standing on the path once again. Life seemed to burst into vivid color for him; the sky, even though hidden behind the canopy of leaves, was bluer than ever, the grass greener, and the air intoxicatingly fresh.

“Shall we keep going?”

“Y-yes,” she replied.

As they emerged from the woods, she kept glancing back toward the thicket. Maybe now, while there’s still time? No one would interrupt her this time.

The light grew brighter, and she realized it was too late. The moment had passed. The forest ended, giving way to an immense field of sun-scorched grass shimmering like gold under the sunlight. Heat enveloped them now.

"I can't hold it, I can't hold it," echoed feverishly in her mind.

She clutched his hand (her palm already damp with sweat), but she felt an even greater dampness down below. Each step sent a jolt to her bladder, which felt unbearably full, and there was no way to loosen her waistband any further.

“Let’s slow down a bit,” she finally exhaled.

He turned to look at her again.

“He always looks at me so intently only when something’s wrong with me,” she thought bitterly.

Her face flushed, then turned pale again.

“I just don’t want to rush. It’s such nice weather.”

“It really is.”

The carefree fool had unzipped his pants, relieved himself under a pine tree, and was perfectly content. In that moment, she both adored and despised the convenience men had been granted in life. Her damp underwear was beginning to ride up uncomfortably, and the ache between her legs was relentless. She tuned out his words entirely, focusing instead on ensuring that any stray drops trickled down her legs rather than hitting the dry ground with an audible splash. Cross your legs. Take tiny steps. Slow him down.

It finally dawned on her—an unshakable realization—that there was no other option but the tall grass. That understanding came with a dull, throbbing pain in her lower belly and yet another betrayal of dampness in her panties. She darted a desperate glance around. No one who might interrupt. No cyclists. Just the two of them, alone in the golden field.

And then, amidst the haze of her singular desire, an idea struck her. If you can’t hide it, turn it into something else. She suddenly flung her arms around his neck, pulling her lower body back, kissed him firmly (but only on the cheek—if he tasted her lips, he’d never let go), and whispered:

“Take a photo?”

“Here?” he asked, pulling out his phone in surprise. Admittedly, it was a picturesque spot.

She nodded and dashed ahead about thirty meters, into the dense, dry, sun-scorched grass that reached her waist. Striking a pose, she spread her arms and pressed her legs together.

“All set!” he gave her a thumbs-up.

“Just a bit longer,” she thought to herself.

With one hand, as discreetly as possible, she pushed her damp panties to the side.

“Now like this!” she exclaimed, spreading her legs wide, bending over, and extending an arm forward like a fencer mid-lunge.

And that’s when it began.

She tried to keep it as inconspicuous as possible, using her other hand to hold her panties from slipping back into place. The stream splashed against the grass, her fingers, and her legs, but at that point, it didn’t matter.

“And now…”

She crouched low enough so only her head peeked out from the grass, lifted her dress inconspicuously, and slid her panties off entirely, releasing a powerful stream in front of her. None of this was visible to him.

“Take a picture like I’m hiding!” she called out. From his perspective, only her joyful face and outstretched arms were visible above the grass.

When it was over, she slipped her underwear back on, quickly wiped her legs and between them with some dry grass, and bounded back to him, beaming like the happiest girl alive.

“Show me, show me!” she clung to his neck eagerly.

The photos were beautiful— a radiant girl in a golden field on a sunny day. She had gifted him those moments and those pictures. And no matter how many times he studied them, even years later, he never realized that he had captured her in the act—peeing, and utterly happy. Only the golden field knew her secret.
