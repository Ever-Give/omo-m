I wrote this like 4 months ago in an art request thread and now I decide I should probably give it its own place, and better formatting, the victim today is Frisk, although in the game they're probably a kid, here it's probably breaking the rule? I mean noone in this specific story do this for sexual pleasure or anything but if that's still not okay just aged them up, I'll probably still write them similarly... this story take place in Waterfall, the room with rain where Frisk walk and talk with Monster Kid (unofficial name) or MK for short, and well... Monster biology is not like human so this actually has been a problem for Frisk for a while already, anyway here is the thing

###

Frisk really need to pee, the last time they do that was in Toriel's bathroom [that I'm just gonna say she probably has somewhere since she had human kids before], and it turned out monsters don't usually use bathroom for anything other than, well, bathing, so they didn't see any public bathroom around, at all. (and they didn't really want to go in someone's bathroom either, that was probably rude, and dirty, since if they only use that for bathing there likely don't have toilet either)

They have been holding this for a long time and to be honest they don't think they can hold that much longer, they need to find somewhere to go, or maybe they can just go? since most monster probably don't know human need to do this and pass it off as some unique thing only some monster do and they wouldn't know since there're so many of them...

They're now in the room with really long hallway ahead, and a can with lots of umbrella, presumably for, well, protecting yourself from the rain that somehow falls here despite it being underground, (the rain really didn't help them holding) they remember the previous rooms and there's nowhere they could go at (they did not want to go in the water, knowing the monsters someone is definitely living there) so the only way is forward.

They pick up an umbrella, go forward, then get stopped by MK, who just stand there for who knows how long, and ask Frisk to come with since they can't hold an umbrella, after continuing a bit, they start chatting, Frisk is concentrating on holding the pee in and looking normal, and so didn't really pay attention on what they're talking about...

"If I was a human, I would wet the bed every night... knowing she was gonna beat me up! Ha ha."

That definitely takes their attention, Frisk panic, MK is their friend, and is probably here with them because they didn't know Frisk is a human, and it turned out 'most monster that didn't know human pee' didn't include MK, so they can't let them know-

"Hey, are you okay? You're shaking."

But that didn't help, the sound and visage of rain, MK talking about wetting the bed, and their own panic, finally make them lose it, the liquid break out of the entrance, soaking their pants rapidly, flowing on their knees, warming their legs, and starting to become a puddle... Frisk look up to see MK's shocked face "A-are you..." Frisk know what conclusion their friend, or maybe former friend now, have come to, solely from the look of their face "I'm sorry!" Frisk cried, and didn't wait for MK's reaction and hit LOAD

QUITTING...

After they go through the same rooms as before from the SAVE point, they have come to the room they loaded. (and, well, have an accident)

Loading the state of the world just to save themself from the embarrassment (and maybe losing a friend, but they are not even sure about that) is probably selfish of them, but they did it in panic and can't change it back, so they'll have to live with it

Saving themself from the embarrassment is good thing but... loading a save also mean their bladder is back to how it was before, that is to say, full, they now really have to go again. (despite hurrying up from last time, they still can't go too fast to not jostle their bottom part too much...)

They did think about how to solve the problem at hand though, they aren't sure how well it was going to work out but half made plan is better than nothing... they started to walk through the room, without an umbrella, then they do what the opposite of what someone trying to avoid the water would do, and try to make the rain hit them as much and at as many place as possible. (it doesn't help Frisk hold it but it help something else, they hope they can hold on until then)

They don't have much time and can't move too quick so they can't do this too much, so after a short while, they walk on "Yo! You can't hold an umbrella either?" let's just go with that "If you're walking anyway, I guess I'll go with you, haha..."

Well, first part of the plan didn't work, good thing that's not the main part, when Frisk continue, they didn't walk normally, "Hey, if we're gonna be wet anyway, why not get it to the max?" they then jump at every puddle they see, (a little rigid doing it not to jostle it too much but noone would probably notice) now both Frisk and MK are wet with rain and puddle water, (MK joined after like, 3 seconds)

"Haha... this is kinda fun huh? I didn't get to do this often!" they leaked a bit in process and is now on the brink of losing any control they have left for the rest of it, but that's not important anymore, THIS is the real plan, they're now wet from outside source and noone would know if they go right now,

Which... is what they're doing actually, they didn't intend to go right now, they just can't hold it anymore, they can feel warm liquid spread and seep through their pants, they try to act casual and walk normally, (which feels weird when they're, you know, peeing their pants) "Yea! This is... fun I guess." they then notice the sound the pee made from hitting their pants, hissing, it's kind of a lot.

Not wanting to get suspicious, they run to jump in another puddle (now with full range of movement from not having to hold it) making big splash, and really loud sound to conceal the noise, then continue doing it until a little after they stop peeing (they try to empty it so they don't have to face this problem again anytime soon, but they're not sure on how successful it was), after that, they come away, both smiling, still being friend (Frisk hope their... pee, didn't hit MK in the splash, but that was probably a little unrealistic, at least they hope it's not much) and Frisk continue their journey, now soaking wet, but that probably solve itself when they get to Hotland, right?

###

End, for now, I don't have any more plan for this yet but maybe if I do I'll post it (to be fair being wet probably doesn't change anything much since shortly afterward they fall into a garbage dump lol)

Also random thing, before I wrote this I planned for Frisk to like, after Loading they try to just, hold it harder with just Determination and willpower, which, well, doesn't really work out, they get like 3 meters farther than last time and failed again, they are really stubborn so they try again and again until they realized this is the absolute limit of their body and then they have to come up with a plan... I didn't want to write all that at the time so it's just this but I think it's enough
