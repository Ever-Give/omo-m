This afternoon when I drove down the highway I was really bursting for the loo, since I had had two iced teas and one coffee at lunch. When I finally found a shop, I parked my car and walked in bending slightly forward.

There was only a single-cubicle bathroom in the shop, and a lady in her early 30s was waiting in front of the locked door. I could barely stand still with my whole body squirming in desperation and my right hand rubbing my tummy, left hand pulling the waist of my shorts away from my lower belly.

‘Er… excuse me’, I asked the lady in front of me, ‘May I use the bathroom before you? I have really drunk a lot water and been driving for like an hour. I’m so uncomfortable right now, and… ouch… it hurts so much! I don’t think I’m able to hold it any longer. I don’t want to ruin my shorts either. I really like them. My boyfriend bought them for me from… And how can I sit in my car after soiling my shorts? I really like my car. She’s fairly new. I only bought it… So could you please? I will make it quick.’

Hearing these words, the lady turned around slowly and squeezed five words between her clenched teeth, ‘At. Least. You. Can. Talk.’
