NOTE: I've been lurking on this forum for years and I thought finally I'd contribute something. This story has been stuck in my brain for a while now, so I thought I'd get it out. If a snarky older Crime Lesbian OC bullying a Intrepid Young Reporter is your cup of tea, come on down!

WARNINGS: I feel like I should flag that this definitely has a dubconny vibe, though it probably won't end up that way. also features plenty of desperation and teasing but probably won't end in wetting, since that's not my bag. But I have an equally fun (at least imo) ending planned. Eagle-eyed readers may be able to guess what. 🙂

This is my first ever omo writing so please be gentle! If you like it lmk and hopefully that will encourage me to get around to writing Part 2.

Oh, sure, stick the 45-year-old woman on babysitting duty. Surely she must have maternal instinct coming out of her eyeballs. It makes Jo sick.

“Hey, quit rattling around over there,” she calls to the hostage chained to the pipe in the corner of the small, damp basement, without bothering to look up. She’s got her foot in her lap and is busy digging a pebble out of her boot with her switchblade. “Unless you want me to use this on you instead.”

“In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t exactly comfortable,” comes the predictably snarky response. Jo rolls her eyes to herself. What a little smartass this one is. Not to mention a pain in the ass. Jo would be glad the patrol team had finally managed to catch Little Miss Investigative Journalist snooping around the facility–finally an end to all of the friggin' meddling–if it hadn’t somehow become HER job to keep an eye on her until the Boss showed up to deal with her.

That imperious bitch was supposed to be here an hour and a half ago. As a loyal and high-ranking lackey, Jo is downright insulted. Not to mention bored to tears. She would have brought a book of crossword puzzles or something if she’d known.

The sound of metal clanking against metal again, handcuff on pipe. The little idiot better not be making some escape attempt. She turns on the girl, growls out, “What the fuck did I just say?”

Not a girl, technically, in her mid-twenties, thoughbut from Jo’s perspective she might as well be a fetus. Olive-skinned and full-figured, just a little baby fat still in her cheeks, with big, brown, angelic-goody-two-shoes eyes and curly hair is held back in a neat ponytail. She's wearing dark, form-fitting clothes and sneakers, which must be her Sneaking Around Where She Isn’t Wanted outfit.

She’d be cute, Jo admits, if she weren’t such a smart-mouthed thorn in their side.

The kid is handcuffed to a pipe on the low ceiling, arms stretched up over her head. The clanking appears to be due to the way she’s currently shifting her weight back and forth from one foot to the other. Aw, are the great Carmen Flores’s feet getting tired? Well that’s just too damn bad.

“You know, I'd be a lot more scared of you if it weren't obvious you're not going to hurt me,” Carmen says. “You clearly don't have permission, or you would have by now.” She says it all brave and defiantly, like the Plucky Heroine she clearly thinks she is. Which is pretty adorable, considering she’s all helpless and strung-up, looking about as intimidating as a kitten.

“Try me,” Jo returns. “I’ve got a short fucking temper.” But she's right, of course. The order came straight from the top: bring her to me unharmed. Jo can't even rough the kid up a little. Booo-ring.

“I need to pee,” Carmen blurts out.

It’s so out of left field that Jo is stunned into silence for a couple seconds. Carmen looks like she’s trying very hard not to look embarrassed. Jo gives her a quick onceover. The tension in her body, the little shifting movements of her hips: it’s obvious she’s telling the truth. So that’s what all the fidgeting is about.

Great. Another chore. Prisoner bathroom breaks are tedious and disgusting. Detaching the person from whatever they’re chained to, leading them over to the revolting bucket in the corner, holding the person up so they can squat in handcuffs or (shudder) holding their dick for them, wiping for them if need be… Ugh.

“Hello?” Carmen says. Like Jo is deaf, or an idiot. Jo feels irritation prickle on her skin. “I’m saying, you need to unchain me. So I can take care of it.” She rushes over the last words a bit, but sounds no less demanding.

Listen to that. Bossy. Sounds like Little Miss Journalism Degree thinks she’s in charge. Sounds like she’s used to being in charge.

In that split second, Jo makes a decision. A decision largely motivated by spite and boredom. Like most of her decisions are.

“Oh. Is that what I need to do?” she asks, pleasantly, and gives Carmen a smile.

“If you don’t want a mess to clean up,” Carmen says, like Jo must be a real dullard to not get that.

“Nah, I’m not on the cleanup crew,” Jo says. “I’m generally the one who makes the messes.” She lifts her boot back into her lap and gets comfortable, flicks open her switchblade and returns to levering out the little stone embedded in the rubber sole. “But either way, ‘fraid I can’t unchain you, sweetheart. Against protocol. You might try and escape.”

She’s bullshitting, of course. There is no fucking protocol.

Carmen gives a short little step from one foot to the other. Looks like it’s getting a little urgent. Maybe it’s been getting urgent for a while. “Your protocol doesn’t allow for human biology? That’s stupid.”

Ooh, someone’s snippy. Jo shrugs. She’s almost worked the pebble out. “You can always try and wait till the Boss gets here. She might give the green light. Though who knows how much longer she’ll be.” The pebble finally pops free, and Jo triumphantly sends it clattering to the floor. Then she glances back up at Carmen and smiles again. “Or I guess I could find a bottle to hold up for you. If you ask nicely.”

She’s betting that Little Miss Snootypants will balk at that suggestion, and it looks like she’s on the money. “Ew,” Carmen says flatly, sarcastically. But she’s also blushing.

Jo shrugs. “Suit yourself.” She leans back in her chair, puts her hands behind her head and her feet up on the bucket she’d dragged over earlier. Nice and comfortable. Ready for the long haul.

Carmen is staring hard back at her, like she’s trying to figure out if she’s joking or not. Then her big eyes blink and her jaw seems to set with determination. “Fine,” she says, almost managing to sound casual about it. “I’ll wait for her. I’m sure she’ll be interested to learn how you’ve been treating her guest.”

Jo beams back at her. “Fine,” she echoes agreeably. The Boss is a stickler for hospitality, it’s true, but technically Jo isn’t disobeying orders. She’s not laying a hand on the kid. Just messing with her a little. ‘Til the Boss gets here, or she gets bored.

Besides, the Boss knows perfectly well by now that this is what happens when you leave Jo alone and bored with a victim. Especially if the victim is sorta cute, and has it coming.

Carmen’s lips press together, in what seems to be both resignation and concentration. She stops shifting, stands up a bit straighter, refusing to meet Jo’s gaze.

That's fine. Jo has all the time in the world. She pulls out her phone, starts scrolling to pass the time, alternating between that and occasional glances up at the developing situation before her.

It doesn’t take long for the kid’s forced composure to falter. Ten minutes, and she’s starting to shift around again. Ten more, and her shapely thighs are squeezing rhythmically against each other, her eyes shut and her expression slightly pinched.

“Getting pretty bad, huh?” Jo calls, breaking the silence.

Carmen’s big eyes blink open, and embarrassment flashes on her face before she can hide it, as if she’d been startled out of a trance of discomfort, hadn’t realized just how openly she’s been dancing. She looks away and doesn’t say anything, refusing to give Jo the satisfaction of a response. “What’d you have to drink, anyways?” Jo asks. No answer.

Well, that’s no fun. Jo swings her feet down from the bucket and gets to her feet. The kid’s backpack, confiscated from her and searched when she’d been caught, is sitting against the far wall. Jo walks over to it and kneels down.

The sound of the zipper gets Carmen’s attention. “Hey!” she protests uselessly. “Stay out of there!”

Jo ignores her, of course. First thing she pulls out is a notebook, one of those college-ruled black and white composition ones. She opens it, flips through the pages, one eyebrow creeping up incredulously. “4:30am: no movement. 5am: shift change. 5:30am: no movement. Jesus Christ, you don’t have much of a life, do you, kid?”

“It’s called a stakeout,” Carmen replies, through slightly gritted teeth, though whether it’s due to her private notes being perused or the mounting pressure in her bladder is unclear. “There’s a lot of waiting around while nothing happens.”

“Gee, is that how stakeouts work?” Please. Jo has been going on stakeouts longer than this little twerp has been alive. She pulls out a pair of gloves next, then what looks like a Geiger counter, then a tape measure. “Look at this. The Girl Scout comes prepared.”

“Care to comment on why the radiation levels in this compound are twice the legal limit?” Carmen replies, managing to sound as smug as someone experiencing a dire need to empty their bladder can possibly sound. One of her legs is now crossed tightly behind the other.

“Sure. ‘Go fuck yourself.’ Feel free to quote me.” Jo reaches back into the bag. This time she pulls out a thermos. A big one. Empty, by the feel of it.

“Aha,” she says triumphantly. “Now we’re getting somewhere.” She unscrews the top; empty as she suspected, but when she sniffs the opening there’s a telltale earthy scent. “Coffee?” She barks out a short laugh. “No wonder you’re tying yourself in knots over there.”

Carmen looks like she wants to protest that no, she’s not. Except she definitely kinda is. And she’s definitely blushing again now that she’s been called out on it. She opts for stubborn silence.

Jo rises to her feet, thermos in hand, walks over to Carmen. “Rookie mistake, sweetheart,” she says, wagging the empty container directly in her face. “Here’s a tip about stakeouts. Don’t drink a gallon of caffeine if you don’t have a plan for where you’re going to put it later.”

“I was planning to put it back into the fucking thermos,” Carmen snaps back. Ooh, swearing, she must be really worked up. “Until your goons came along and…” She cuts herself off, realizing too late what she’s admitting to.

But the damage is done. “Caught you with your pants down?” Jo asks, grinning. This is great.

“No.” Carmen is glowing redder than a Christmas tree ornament, and also looking at Jo like she can’t believe a woman her age is such a juvenile prick.

Jo gets that a lot.

Might as well lean in. Jo looks down at the thermos in her hands, gives a thoughtful hum. “It’s too bad you didn’t get the chance to piss before we nabbed you, really,” she remarks, casually. “All that coffee. You must be bursting.”

Carmen’s breath seems to stutter. She’s starting to look a little sweaty. “Thanks for your concern,” she says, stiffly.

“Bet you could fill this thing all the way back up,” Jo goes on, cheerfully. The teasing comes naturally to her; she’s always been good at winding people up. “And then some, huh? Wouldn’t that be a relief. I could even hold it up for you like I said.”

Carmen’s eyes dart to Jo’s face. There’s a glint of desperation in them that Jo knows well from prior experience. Her resolve is starting to falter. She’s actually considering asking for the thermos. Subjecting herself to humiliation to get the relief her body craves. And isn’t that a little delicious. Almost as delicious as the urgent discomfort creasing that sweet, youthful face, the way her hands are clenching and twisting in their bonds over her head, how those curvy legs can’t seem to wrap themselves around each other tightly enough.

It’s possible Jo is enjoying this a little too much. Well, plenty of time to unpack that later.

She lets the hand with the thermos drop down to her side. “I mean, not that I’m going to,” she says nonchalantly, returning to Carmen's bag and dropping the thermos back inside. Then she heads back to her chair and drops back down into it. “You being such a little amateur and all, you’d probably miss and pee all over yourself, and then I’d have to smell it.

“Besides, Boss should be here any minute now. You can make it till then. Right?”

Carmen’s breathing is shallow. She gives a little curtsy. “Right,” she responds through her teeth, though it’s clear she's speaking out of nothing but sheer, stubborn pride.

Jo sits back again and smiles. And to think of how impatient she’d been earlier. The Boss can take all the time she needs.

Part 2! enjoy!

###

Twenty minutes later, the kid hasn’t broken yet. Jo is almost impressed. Or she would be, if she weren’t having so much fun.

Still no sign of the Boss. No word from her, either. What a shame. Any conversation in the basement has long since ceased: the only sounds echoing around the space now are the clink of handcuffs against pipe; the rasp of fabric on fabric; and Carmen’s shallow, ragged breathing, punctuated by the occasional strained little grunt.

The kid has her eyes shut tight and her legs twisted together even more tightly. She’s squeezing her thigh muscles against each other for all they’re worth, occasionally switching her hips from one side to the other. Her little white teeth are worrying at her lower lip, her face drawn with discomfort, sweat beading on her high forehead. Her wrists, twisting in the cuffs over her head, look like they’ve been rubbed a little raw.

Aw. Poor thing. It must be just awful.

Jo is practically grinning as she reclines comfortably in her front row seat. This is certainly getting interesting. She can only imagine how full Carmen’s bladder is, after everything she had to drink and how long it’s been. Not that the kid doesn't deserve it: it's her own fault for snooping around where she isn't wanted. She keeps half-expecting to see those contorted pant legs suddenly darken and glisten, flooded with hot urine that can no longer be contained. And yet, miraculously, they’re still bone dry. Jo has to hand it to the kid: she’s got some serious willpower.

Jo wonders when that willpower will start to fray.

She clears her throat conspicuously. Carmen’s eyes fly open and instantly lock on her. Isn’t that cute: kid’s still holding on to hope.

Jo gives her a cheerful smile. “Sorry,” she says. “It’s a little dry down here.” Then she leans over to her own bag, sitting on the ground beside her chair. It contains her usual gear, along with some of her favorite toys (just in case she encounters someone who needs convincing), and, of course, a few granola bars and a water bottle, in case of long waits just like this one.

Jo pulls out the water bottle. She unscrews the cap, tilts it to her lips, and helps herself to a long, cool, refreshing drink.

She lets out a sigh of exaggerated satisfaction as she pulls it from her lips, wiping her mouth with her sleeve. “Ahh. I needed that.” Then she looks back up at Carmen, who is staring at her with those big brown eyes stretched wide, like she just can’t tear them away.

Jo raises an innocent eyebrow and proffers the bottle at her. The water inside sloshes audibly. “Thirsty?”

Carmen has gone, for the first time, totally stock still. Except for her legs, which are now clenched together so tightly that they appear to be ever-so-slightly trembling. Suddenly, she gives a little, hitching gasp.

“Unchain me,” she demands, wild-eyed, her voice so strained and breathy that it sounds anything but authoritative. “Unchain me right now, I– I can’t–”

Oh, dear. Sounds like Little Miss Golden Girl is finally at the end of her rope.

“Mm, sorry, no can do,” Jo hums. God, she is an evil bastard, isn’t she? The pleasant heat of a power trip is flooding into her veins as she watches the kid fight not to let everything go in her pants. “I already told you, that darn protocol. Remember?”

Carmen’s fevered eyes dart over to her own backpack, over by the wall where Jo had left it. Instantly, Jo knows exactly what she’s thinking. “Whatcha lookin’ at?” she asks anyways, in a sing-song voice that’s probably like nails on a chalkboard to Carmen’s ears.

Carmen shuts her eyes again. “...Please,” she says after a moment, and it’s clear that just saying the word pains her almost as much as her exploding bladder.

Unfortunately, it’s just not good enough. Not for Jo. She crosses her arms over her chest, and tilts her head. “Please what?”

Carmen jaw works with visible anger, reluctance. But she has no other option, and they both know it. “...Please let me pee in the thermos,” she finally grits out through her teeth, eyes clamped shut tight. So pathetic it’s almost enough to make Jo feel bad for her.

Or it would be, if that look on her face weren’t so very, deeply satisfying.

Jo heaves a big, put-upon sigh, then pushes herself up from her chair. She indulges in a long, luxurious stretch. “Fine,” she yawns out, then drops her arms and finally starts ambling over in the direction of Carmen’s backpack.

Carmen is literally quivering as Jo stoops down to unzip the bag again. Reaching in, she lays her hand on the thermos right away, but rustles the rest of the contents around anyway, pretending to be searching through them. “Let’s see. Thermos, thermos, thermos…” she muses aloud. “Hard to find anything in all this junk…”

“For fuck’s sake, hurry up,” Carmen snaps, voice thready with desperation, and Jo is in such a generous mood that she decides not to hold it against the kid. After all, it really does sound like she’s about to burst. And she supposes that Little Miss Pulitzer Prize has been punished enough for one night, without also pissing in her pants and being forced to stand there in it.

Jo walks over to where the great Carmen Flores is now once again performing a tight, shimmying dance, twisting her hips and stomping her feet, only this time it looks like if she stops for even a second it’ll be game over. Her hands are in fists in their bonds.

Up close, Jo can see the sweat shining on Carmen’s upper lip, the pink flush gracing her cheeks, can hear each quick, shallow breath passing in and out. She smirks as she unscrews the lid of the thermos. “Gonna have to uncross your legs, sweetheart.”

Carmen makes a noise in her throat. “...I’m not sure I can,” she admits.

“You have to if we’re gonna pull this off. I gotta pull your pants down and stick this between your legs. It’ll just take a sec. Then you can piss to your heart’s content.”

Carmen gives a strangled groan, head tilting back. “Don’t,” she begs the ceiling, one leg raising off the floor as her knee presses into the opposite thigh. “Don’t say things like that. Fine. Just hurry. Please.”

Jo hadn’t even intended to tease the kid. Not this time. But there’s something about the tormented moan, the pleas for relief, that makes her feel a familiar tingle between her legs.

It’s probably time that she admits to herself that she is definitely, 100% turned on right now.

Still. She’s a woman of her word. (Sometimes. When she feels like it.) She sticks the thermos under her arm to free up both her hands, then steps forward to undo Carmen’s fly. Even under these circumstances that have nothing to do with sex, there’s something intimate about the act, standing close enough to feel the girl’s body heat and smell her sweat as she undoes the button, tugs down the zip to reveal a flash of white cotton. Jo snorts. “Granny panties. Why am I not surprised.”

There’s no witty rejoinder from the kid this time. She appears to be busy mouthing something to herself, her face screwed up with concentration.

“Hey! Stay with me.” Carmen’s big brown eyes blink open to look into Jo’s, and Jo can see that they’re shining with tears of strain. It really is torture, isn’t it? Something else twinges in Jo, ever-so-distantly. The feeling is so unfamiliar that it takes her a second to put her finger on it.

A tiny scrap of empathy. Oh, for fuck’s sake. “Look,” Jo says gruffly, “We’ll do it on the count of three, OK?”

Carmen shuts her eyes again and simply nods, quite possibly because she’s at the point where speaking will cause her to lose all control.

Jo takes hold of Carmen’s waistband with both hands, slipping her thumbs inside the waistband of her underwear as well. “One. Two. Three.”

Carmen parts her legs with a high-pitched gasp. In one fell swoop, Jo pulls her pants and underwear halfway down her smooth, brown thighs.

Between the kid’s legs is a patch of soft, dark, neatly trimmed (of course) pubic hair and a glistening pink slit. Jo only realizes how long she’s been standing there motionless, staring like a pubescent boy, when the glistening becomes a welling drop of liquid. It trembles then falls, lands on the amazingly-as-of-yet-dry gusset of Carmen’s panties and sinks into the fabric. Carmen gasps again. “Hurry–”

Jo finds that her hands are fumbling a bit more than usual, but she manages to shove the thermos between the kid’s legs just in time.

Piss explodes from between Carmen’s legs. A thick, powerful stream is now absolutely thundering into the vessel in Jo’s hand, so that Jo can literally feel the sheer force of the need now finally being satisfied.

Even if she couldn’t, the broken groan of relief that rips itself from Carmen’s throat is evidence enough of just how dire the urge to void had been, of how wonderful it feels to be emptying herself now. The kid’s whole body is sagging in its bonds with sheer relief, dangling there in pure bliss as she pisses like a firehose.

And pisses. And pisses. Jo can hardly believe how long she’s been pissing, or how hard. She catches herself staring, once again, at the powerful jet of pee shooting out from the slit between Carmen’s legs and into the thermos, at the drops of liquid caught in her bush, glinting in the dim light. Jo glances up, self-conscious, but finds that the kid’s eyes are shut again, this time in sheer relief, her jaw hanging slack with pleasure, her face rosy, some of her curls plastered to her cheek with sweat.

In addition to the tingling wetness between her legs, Jo feels heat climbing up from under her collar and into her face. Wait. Is she blushing? Oh, fuck no. What is she, twelve??

Jo looks away and clears her throat, willing the heat in her face away. Carmen’s pee stream has lessened somewhat, but is still going strong. Jesus, she really is going to fill the thing up, isn’t she? “You’re kinda shrimpy to have this much room in the tank, aren’t you, sweetheart?” Jo says aloud, mainly to distract herself from the hiss and splatter still ongoing between them. As the thermos fills with hot piss, it’s growing warm in her grip.

Carmen huffs out a laugh, sounding thoroughly spent. Her pee stream is finally slowing to a trickle, petering out. “I’ll take that,” she says, between pants, “As a compliment.” Guess there's no bringing her down from this high. With a few last drips, she finally finishes, heaving one last sigh of relief.

“It’s nice to see you two getting along so well,” says a smooth, low voice from the back corner of the room.

Carmen gives a little yelp, her eyes flying open. Jo jumps and very nearly drops a thermos full of urine all over herself. Then she growls with irritation. “What the hell took you so long?” she demands, turning around.

The Boss, blonde and petite in her fancy little tailored suit, is smiling that goddamned obnoxious, knowing smile she’s always smiling, lurking in the goddamned shadows, just like she always does. As her keen eyes dip over them, Jo becomes hyper-aware of Carmen’s lowered pants, of the object she’s currently holding in her guilty hands, of the pinkness she can still feel burning in her own face.

“Seems like you found a way to keep busy,” the Boss hums, and Jo groans internally with the certain knowledge that from now until the end of time, she will never hear the end of it.
