Hinata pov

I wake up and I hear the sound of the shower in the distant that means that Naruto is in the shower I start to rub my big 8 months pregnant belly when my bladder start to hurt, so that’s why I’m awake I feel so full last night I drink a lot of water because I feel thirsty and all the water is in my bladder begging to come out I slowly get out of bed and go to the only bathroom in the apartment.

Knock knock

H:are you almost done?

N: I just get in why? You want to puke?

H: No, I just want to pee but I can’t wait

N: are you sure because I can’t get out if you want

H: No no I’m sure just don’t be too long

I wanted to cry my bladder hurts so much I don’t know why I said to Naruto that I can wait slowly I kneeled in the floor with one wand in the door knob and the other in my croch I have a little leak, hearing the sound of the water isn’t helping but I know if I go back to the bed I will wet the bed, another leave and another I start to loss control a little the I have a huge leak and I just couldn’t hold it and the pee start to run full force out on me.

I started to cry and I don’t know when I stop or when the sounds of the running water stop, I just feel Naruto trying to open the door so I just move a side and Naruto hug me while I was crying and then he carry me to the shower and take my clothes out and he helped me taking the shower because I still was crying.

When we were in the bedroom I stared to apologize.

H: IIm sorry iii should waaait

N: hey Hina it doesn’t matter you had an accident every one has one so don’t worry love

H:B-b-but I-I am pregnant soon I will have to teach Boruto to leave the diapers and how I am supposed to do that if I am not able to stay dry myself

N: Hina don’t worry about that you are strong and today you only have and accident because the bathroom was occupied and you drink a lot last night, and you will be and asome mother and we will teach Bolt to leave the diapers, and if he has and accident that wouldn’t be a problem because everyone has one even you or me

H: thank you for cheer me up

N: any time my love$$
