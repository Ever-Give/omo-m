(Small idea I had, first time posting any writing here!)

###

She’s a good girl. Very willing to please.

.

Evie Meskin had been holding her pee for seven hours now, and it didn’t look like that would be ending any time soon. She smoothed the palms of her hands over her skirt (the grey one, the one her friend Nini said made her look taller) and tried not to jiggle her legs. She’d known what she was getting into, after all; she just hadn’t expected it to start quite so soon!

What are they even doing in there? Sucking each other’s cocks? Well, Evie had seen the carpet, in the office she’d been so cordially locked outside of: she hoped they had Neosporin for the rug burn. Though, if the carpets here were being changed multiple times a year, she supposed it made sense they’d be budget quality… Evie caught her left foot tapping and jammed her heel forcibly into the polished floor, wincing at the dent in the wood. Oops. She hadn’t even been told to wear heels here, she’d just… wanted to make a good impression.

A good impression before pissing yourself, the voice in her head mocked, gaining a distinctly gleeful lilt. Don’t worry about that scuff-mark, I’m sure these floors have seen a lot worse!

This was definitely part of it, right? Leaving her out here while inside they droned on and on, muffled voices the only thing she could hear despite how hard she’d tried to listen (that had been during the first hour). Seven hours since her last bathroom break at that truck stop on the road, four hours of hilly mountain road, who-knows-how-long wandering around trying to find the correct entrance and go over the paperwork and then… her watch beeped, informing her it was 1800. An hour and forty-three minutes sitting outside this damn room filling up even more from the tea and fruit juice she’d been too nervous to refuse.

God. She really had to pee.

If they were going to forget about her, she might as well do something to help herself hold. Bouncing her legs was still out (these shoes under these high ceilings echoed) but there was no reason she couldn’t cross her legs. Carefully-- looking up and down the hallway to check for passers-by, though she’d seen nobody else since she’d come to sit out here-- she slipped her left leg over her right and pressed a fist at the apex of her thighs, where it would be hidden from view. Fuck. Evie tilted her head back against the wood-paneled wall and breathed out through her nose. She’d been clenching her muscles as hard as she could, but she could feel that they were getting tired, achy. If she let a tiny bit out, would it even show up on her skirt? Maybe it would dry before those inconsiderate jerks even came out to tell her where to go next.

Don’t, she told herself. You promised you’d be good. And that sent a shiver down her spine, shifting her hips unconsciously against the too-thin cushion of the bench she’d been relegated to until someone decided she was worth remembering. Never mind the tea and juice, or the bottles of water you drank in the car coming here, or the lemonade with lunch that definitely didn’t have time to make it through her system before that truck stop. Her bladder throbbed. You don’t even know where the restrooms are, even if they do come out in the next fifteen minutes, could you find them before you wet yourself? She swallowed as the back of her neck flushed hot. Drip… drip… drip… drip… what’s that?

Evie tore open her eyes and saw a woman with a mop leaning against the wall between the two elevators, eyeing the drops from the bottom as she lifted the braided ends out of a soapy bucket before her. The bucket was more full than Evie would have expected, for this kind of work. She realized she was squirming and tried to stop. She was almost successful.

“Hello,” she squeaked, and then blushed darker, jamming her fist more firmly between her legs. “I’m sorry to bother you, but would you be able to point me the way to the bathroom? Just for now, they haven’t-- I’m—” her free hand was flailing. Mortified, Evie dropped it to her side, where it immediately curled around the edge of the bench and gripped tight. “Um. If you wouldn’t mind.”

The woman raised her eyes to meet Evie’s with the kind of slow stateliness reserved for royal processions, and did not respond. She dunked the mop back into the bucket and pumped it up and down a few times. The sloshing was agony. Evie’s thighs pressed so tightly together she was almost worried she’d lose feeling.

“Fuck,” she whispered under her breath. Oh, she hoped the woman hadn’t heard her. “I’m sorry! I just, if it’s around the corner or down a flight of stairs or something, if you could tell me?” A wave of heat pulsed through her abdomen, and Evie clenched her teeth around her own question: a moment later she realized she could feel wetness seeping into the cotton of her panties. The first leak. “Please, maybe if you don’t know, you could tell me who to ask?”

Slosh, slosh. Drip, and drip again. A whimper rose in Evie’s throat, but she choked it back before it could escape. “It’s a little bit of, um. An emergency. You see.” She was so red now she could feel it spreading to her chest, the very top of her head, the rush of blood making her dizzy. Both of her hands were white-knuckled. Seven hours. Why did she accept the tea? She knew it was a diuretic, she could have pretended to be sensitive to caffeine and gotten by with just the juice.

Don’t think about the juice. Evie’s legs were shaking now, and she couldn’t control it. “That’s okay, I’ll just wait to see if anyone else!” She’s the first person you’ve seen walk by in two hours. There isn’t going to be anyone else The walls of her bladder squeezed in, excitement and alarm, and Evie jolted forward over her knees. “Do you come here often? Sorry, um, that was so rude, and not what makes sense at all, I’m being stupid. I just, kind of have to pee?”

Nothing about the woman’s face made it seem like she cared, or even heard Evie at all. Only that unwavering gaze, steady, as Evie’s desperate bladder muscles definitely were not. She lifted the mop and let it slap (cruelly, Evie thought in near-hysteria) against the tiles, water seeping around it to form a puddle. Another dribble of wetness leaked out into her panties. Fuck. She really wasn’t going to make it. Why that tea! Idiot!

Squish, slap slap. Squish, slap slap. Drip, drop, drip.

Evie closed her eyes again and forced back another whine, using both hands to hold herself now. The fullness of her bladder was absolute: past absolute. It was so full even the expansion of her lungs threatened to force the urine out of her: there wasn’t enough room in her body. “Oh, fuck. Ma’am, I’m very sorry, but if you can’t tell me where a bathroom is I’m afraid I’m going to-- ah!” That leak had felt good, dangerously so. “I really hope these cushions are waterproof!”

Sploosh. Back into the bucket. As Evie curled over herself, helpless to straighten up, the woman grasped the wire handle and leisurely walked across the wide space to stand in front of Evie. Finally, she thought, though she had no idea what for. Clearly she wasn’t being helped to a bathroom. Unless--

“They aren’t,” the woman said, her first time speaking. Her voice was low and icily cold. Then, with one hand as if bored by the motion, she titled the bottom of the bucket up and poured a long stream of water onto the floor.

“No,” Evie gasped, as the rushing in her ears came to a head. “Oh, no, fuck, no no nonononono—” but it was too late: she tried to clamp down, but the splashing was more than her bladder could take. Pee gushed between her legs, spilling through the gusset of her pantyhose and into the wool of her skirt. She could feel it pooling underneath her, the force of it too strong to soak into even these-- not waterproof, her mind helpfully supplied-- cushions immediately; overflow poured down to her hem, sending rivulets to patter around her shoes. With a moan, Evie finally managed to wrench her tortured bladder closed-- but it was too late. She had wet herself, and this-- strange?-- woman had watched the whole thing.

Her heart beat frantically in her throat. The small amount of pee still in her bladder swirled. Sooner rather than later, it would come out as well.

The bucket was empty; Evie wished she could say the same. The woman turned it over and propped a corner on her hip, and for the first time an emotion flashed in her dark eyes. Evie was too addled to tell what it was, but it might have been interest.

“Welcome to my home, Ms. Meskin,” the woman said, as Evie’s sodden pantyhose began to cool against her skin. “I hope you enjoy your stay. I’m sure you’ll fit in here perfectly.”

Haha thank you!!! I hadn't thought about writing more, but I guess it does kind of sound like the beginning of something doesn't it? Maybe I'll expand the universe if I have another idea!! I'm so glad you liked it!!
