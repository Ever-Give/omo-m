You quickly fallow white down the hall fallowing her all the way to security before she notices you behind her, "are you just going to keep fallowing me?" you can go on your own if you want" you only shrug lightly, White looks back ahead, you make your move, your grab her shoulder and pull her into security shutting the doors with the panel "what are you-?" White falls down after you let go of her arm smacking her head against the floor, "ow!" you sit there for a moment watching white struggle to get up.

(oh boy here we go)

You decide to end it with white, you take a step forward and pull out a knife from your pocket, it was fun while it lasted but this was to perfect of a kill opportunity to miss, White soon managed to stand up but her legs shook with desperation and fear, you grabbed her by the arm and pulled her closer with your knife held up in the air, you take a moment to look down, "p-please dont kill me" you smiled as the floor became wet the only lightest sound of dripping coming from whites feet as you had held her up in the air being taller than her, you let go of her arm and let her fall onto the floor, "if you tell anyone ill kill you..." you dropped her knife and opened the vent hatch jumping inside before she could respond. "white are you alright? I tried to get the door unstuck" you heard greens voice from above luckily you had gotten away in time.

(ik the ending was bad but its my first time ok?)
