Gonta wandered the forest searching for insects, alongside his buddy, Shuichi. While he caught bugs, he accidentally went in too deep and now doesn’t know how to get out...

(There isn’t any Gonta omorashi out there, so I decided to fix that by doing this roleplay, Please note this will later be posted on Archive Of Our Own-by replying you are giving me permission to upload it. I’ll be sure to credit you in the description. Also mods please move I meant to put this in the role play section ;-;
