If you could do anything with Bad- I know he's probably not the type of character you'd think of to do but literally any Bbh Omo would be amazing. I'm not caught up like at all for dsmp btw but an idea would be to maybe have it where he has to do something for the egg like host a meeting and the egg denies him access to the bathroom until he's bursting (or having an accident hehe)
