I apologize if it’s inappropriate to make a new thread like this. If it’s deleted I understand. But I want to do a story trade with someone. I have a short outline and would write a story for that person after. You can see samples of my work on my profile. PM me

I would suggest you to at least specify what kind of story you want to have written for you. At least the basic outline if not anything else, in that case, people will know if they want to go for the trade or not.

You’re right. It’s a female desperation story of one who wakes up and holds it till the last minute. I have an outline

I had something a bit like that during the beginning of one of my stories, here

. It’s not the main focus, it’s just something I remembered happening before the main story started and I included it anyway.

Hopefully you enjoy it.

Would you want to do a story trade? I have an outline for a male and female story (one or other) ...

Maybe. I normally just write for fun, but I could I suppose. I’m only interested in female desperation though.

I have a female one. Cute girl stuck at a party as the bathroom is being held up by a mean person. Sort of like the one I’m writing now....but different story

Let me know if interested
