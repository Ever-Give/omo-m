Hello!

I'm thinking of writing some sort of story or interactive story.

I've seen many complaints and also truly have the desire to share one I have written on my own- so without further ado, I am simply inquiring which of these you would like to see

- A female mercenary in a medieval setting, most likely

- Some sort of world where magic is very common, a fantasy setting. (Again, female main character, but explain which role would be preferred. Perhaps priestess, college student of magic, etc.)

- A very mundane, normal setting that involves going to school and likely a turbulent home life.

State which of these would be most preferred and whether you would prefer an interactive story or a normal story, please!

The interactive story may not be as interactive as most because I will have two to three options, I would like to follow some sort of plot but the choices will still be available

Also feel free to list any other requests! This is a request post essentially, and will be locked with a link to the actual story when ready!

Alright, so then would you prefer an interactive or a normal story??

Also, what sort of character?
